# [[Creating a database with Dataview]]

*Note: For using the DB Folder plugin, see [[Creating a database with Database Folder]].*

## Description

This workflow helps you:
- Create a new database of stuff in Obsidian (for tracking people, places, events, orders, anything you want)
- Create new items according to a template
- Collate all created items using a Dataview query

## Plugins used

- Templater
- Dataview
- Buttons
- QuickAdd

## Instructions

1. Modify the template [[dbitem]] to include the fields you'd like each item to have.
2. In [[Database of Stuff]], click on the *Create new database* button. If you don't see any such button, hit the arrow key to go down until you see code appear on the line before `^button-newdbitem`. Then hit down again to exit out of the code block until you can see the button. Click on it.
3. In the dialog box, type the title of your new item and hit enter.

Your new item should be created, and it should also now appear in [[Database of Stuff]].

From now on, you can create new items either using the button in [[Database of Stuff]] or by using the Command Pane (CTRL/CMD P) and then selecting *QuickAdd: Template - Add DB item.*

Use this sample database as a template for your own databases. As always, feel free to modify any or all parts of it to fit your purposes.
