# [[Using Daily and other Periodic Notes]]


## Description

This workflow lets you:
- Create daily notes automatically for each:
	- day, according to the template [[daily]]
	- week, according to the template [[weekly]]
	- month, according to the template [[monthly]]
	- quarter, according to the template [[quarterly]]
	- year, according to the template [[yearly]]
- Show this week/month/quarter/year's goals in periodic notes, as appropriate.
- Display a random note that needs to be processed (i.e., those that have the tag `#inbox`).


## Plugins used

- Periodic Notes
- Calendar
- Templater
- Dice Roller

## Instructions

1. Go to today's note by either opening up Obsidian, clicking on today's date in the Calendar plugin on the right pane, hitting the shortcut `CMD K`, or opening up the Command Palette (`CMD/CTRL P`) and choosing _Periodic Notes: Open daily note_.
2. Switch to Preview mode to view the random page to process (as displayed by Dice Roller).
3. Fill out your daily note as your day goes on!

*Note:* Don't use Templater to create daily notes (by going to the Command Pane and selecting _Templater: Create new note from template_, then _daily_). Instead, try either of the two methods outlined in step 1 above.
