## Description

This workflow helps you:
- Create a new database of stuff in Obsidian (for tracking people, places, events, orders, anything you want)
- Create new items according to a template
- View all database items in a table
- Add filters, new items, or new values in a WYSIWIG format

## Plugins used

- Dataview
- Database Folder
- Templater

## Instructions

1. Modify the template [[dbitem]] to include the fields you'd like each item to have.
2. In [[Alternative Database of Stuff]], click on the + icon at the bottom left.
3. In the *Select template* field, select/type out `templates/dbitem.md`.
4. Type out the filename of the new item you want to add. Hit enter.

Your new item should be created, and it should also now appear in the database as well. Play around with the fields and filters so that it looks the way you want!

Use this sample database as a template for your own databases. As always, feel free to modify any or all parts of it to fit your purposes.
