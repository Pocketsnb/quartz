# [[Creating Agendas for meetings]]


## Description

This workflow helps you:
- Maintain a personal database of people you meet with regularly.
- Add notes for new people according to the [[person]] template.
- Add notes to an agenda with people you meet regularly.
- Embed that agenda the next time you meet with that person.

## Plugins used

- QuickAdd
- Templater

## Instructions

1. Create a new note in the `people` folder. You can do this right clicking on the folder from the File Explorer view within Obsidian and clicking *New Note*. A note will be created, with the [[person]] template automatically applied.
2. Fill out the rest of the note with the person's details.
3. In the Quick Add plugin settings, copy the choice labeled *Capture - Add to agenda with Pepe*, but replace Pepe's name with the person's name.
4. (optional) Add a hotkey in the Hotkeys setting if you'd like.
5. Whenever you think of something to add to the agenda, use the hotkey for the new Capture command or use CMD P, then select *Capture - Add to agenda with Pepe*.
6. In the dialog box, type in what you wanted to add to the agenda. It will automatically be added to the person's page, under the `## Agenda` section.

For more information,
- Check out the sample person note for [[Pepe]]. You can test out the Quick Add capture by using the Command Pane (CMD/CTRL P) to run the command called *Capture - Add to agenda with Pepe*. Verify the results in [[Pepe]] afterwards.
