# Background
As a child, John Hinkleberry loved tree's. He'd climb them whenever he had the chance, sleep in their boughs, and pretend he could speak with the squirrels and birds. After his mother died, he didn't have much time for such "frivolities" as his father put them. They soon moved to a large city, where such things were frowned upon.

In college, John studied botany before being pressured by his father into education to become a professor, "just like him". However, prior to starting his doctorate, his father died to tuberculosis. Nothing holding him to where he was, John moved to a different State and a smaller city, and now works as a substitute middle-school teacher.

He still keeps up with new plant discoveries, tends a few potted plants in his Studio apartment, and takes care of his pet iguana Pretzel. But John wishes he could live in the woods, but who does that?  And how could he afford it on a substitutes salary? And so he goes camping when he can, leaving his key to his neighbor and friend, trusting Pretzel and his plants are safe when he does so.
