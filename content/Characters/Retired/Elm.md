# Elm
## Description

## Background
"Elm" is named after one of the greatest hero in Redemsia, Elmara Iantoris. His parents, famous adventurers in their own right, saw fit to name their child such, for who else would be better for the name than their child. During his childhood, Elm was often taken on adventures with his parents and their compatriots, and as such, has learned an odd selection of languages, skills, and swordsmanship from some of the best in the world.

One day, his parents brought home a cursed item which Elm promptly got attached to. His parents, thinking to teach him a lesson, asked Elm to deal with the curse himself, but being stubborn, Elm has carried the cursed item for 10 years.

Currently the deck-hand on a sailing ship, Elm is looking to start an adventure with his own set of companions to make a name for himself and overcome the shadow of greatness his family has.

### Training
Fighting and the Giant language from a goliath fighter (Will "The Mortician" Calaway)
Performance and Disguise from a human bard (Uwe Horn)
Celestial and Infernal from an aasimar paladin (Isabelle Redemée)
Arcana and History from his elven father and wizard (Aru "The Watcher" Silverhand)
Athletics and Survival from his human mother and ranger (Ariel Silverhand)

### Growing Up
Although Elm is from Redemsia, he has only lived there for moments at a time. Because of the adventuring life his parents led, they could afford to live in Satin Park, but decided it would be a waste and instead chose a tenement house in Hope Town as their living quarters.
During his early childhood, while his parents were off adventuring, he would be watched over by Ms. Quillbeak, an old kenku neighbor, who still watches over the house that's vacant much of the time. When his parents were present, his father would teach him the history of the world and aspects of the arcane, while his mother would take him into the wilderness to hunt. On occasion, other famous adventurers would stop by, a few of which were his parents companions.
When he grew older, his parents would often take him on adventures. It was during these excursions he learned how to wield a sword from the goliath Will "The Mortician" Calaway, stage performance from the bard Uwe Horn, and planar languages from the paladin Isabelle Redemée. During these outings, he would often be left at the nearest tavern, where he'd hear tales from other adventurers and their exploits.
