# Spite
## Description

## Background
Spite is from a bygone war. Created by devils to assist in their machinations as a soldier and sent to the material plane, Spite was a part of a major battle that was lost, where they were left behind in a desert for thousands of years. After finally escaping the desert sands they were trapped under (possibly by another players actions, whom Spite is grateful towards), they find that their contract with the devils has ended and Spite now holds a grudge against their infernal makers. As blunt as their fists and preferring direct action, Spite often finds themselves having to wait while others plan.

Being a part of the infernal war nearly 7000 years ago, Spite was lost in the desert after an unexplained explosion, covered and preserved by the sands till uncovered.

Spite seems to not have a fear of deadly situations, willingly going into combat. They are also not a planner or strategist, but will evaluate any plans handed to them before deciding to go along or act off the cuff. Spite also has a soft spot for the group of people that rescued them from the endless death in the sands, and will risk life and limb to keep them safe.

However, Spite has a blinding hatred towards devils, such that it overrides every other aspect of their personality, resulting in them ignoring everything else until all devils they can perceive are gone.

Because Spite was created by devils, they used to have an affinity towards laws and order. After the contract that was written on their soul expired (whether because the time expired, the purpose completed, or the contract destroyed), they find themselves opposing the forced servitude and the aspects that used to define them.

During the war Spite was a soldier, who was connected to a web of consciousness with others collectively known as Legion, following the orders of given to them. While fighting in the desert, some unknown explosion buried them beneath sands, where they stayed for thousands of years.

Spite now wishes to uncover what caused the explosion, and to see the end of the hells.

### Unravelling the Past
The devils were gone 1000 years after the Ophelians appeared.
