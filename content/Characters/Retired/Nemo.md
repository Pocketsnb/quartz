# Nemo
## Description

## Background
Nemo Braewind is an adolescent. Everyone in is family has been sorcerer, except for him. His parents run a minor magic shop where he mainly works as a clerk, though he has tried carving wooden figurines, but nothing he creates looks like anything. On occasion, he's taken money from the shops safe to purchase treats. Recently, his parents have become ill. He's out and about trying to earn money to send back home while his older sister looks after the shop and his parents.

### Breug Crad
At age 7, Nemo visited the fair, at around 3 months prior to campaign start, his parents became ill, and 1 month prior, he set out on a boat to a port closer to Morturn, traveled across land to Delrhia Outpost, and within the last week, made it across to Pendle Crossroads. He probably had some sort of odd experience in the Undercroft (assuming it's on the way) and is slowly starting to figure out how to manifest psionic powers. Wisps of energy in his hands, accidentally hearing others thoughts.
