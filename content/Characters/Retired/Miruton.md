# Miruton
## Description

## Background
From a large family that made its money and reputation inventing games (dragonchess one of the better known ones), Miruton spends most of his free time lazing about his families estate, getting drunk at local pubs, or picking fights with his many cousins. A rival house, the Pakukipa, has a lovely daughter, Sara, whom Miruton is infatuated with, but Pakukipa are a rival game creating family, having created the more popular Three-Dragon Ante. Recently, the Burodomedo family has fallen on tough times and a third noble house, the toymaking Hattofirudo family, are looking to ursurp Mirutons family, gain control of the estate, and win favor with the king.
