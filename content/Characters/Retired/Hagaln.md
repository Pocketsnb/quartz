# Hagaln
## Description

## Background
Hebern comes from a village near an old forest where everyone is born with a twin, his was named Hagaln. Ostensibly, on their 17th birthday, a trial overseen by the town elders is held to determine which of the twins will be sent out into the world to seek their life, never to return. In reality the trial is held to determine which of the twins will be sacrificed, as under the town is a pit where occasional howls escape and whenever someone is tossed into the pit, the howls stop.
During the trial, it was decided that Hebern would be "sent" from the town, but on the night before being sacrificed his twin, Hagaln, overheard the elders discussing what was to happen. Frightened, they told Hebern and bid him to flee and he did so. Days after travelling through the forest Hebern stumbled upon an encampment of paladins. Telling them his story they followed Hebern back to the village.
Once returned the paladins could find no evidence of there being anything at odds, but decided to remain for a few days, and returned Hebern to his home. Speaking with his parents, Hebern found out that Hagaln passed themselves off as Hebern and told a tale of Hagaln running away because they could not part with their twin. Asking where they were, his parents revealed they was sent out into the world as was decided, causing Hebern to lose sensibility at the realization of what occurred. 
His parents, still believing him to still be Hagaln but so grieved at losing contact with his twin that he took on the others persona, implored the paladins to take him away, hoping that their tutelage might calm his mind and that he might some day find his twin. Accepting, they took Hebern away and tutored him.
Hebern now believes himself to be Hagaln, trained as a paladin and believing the lie that his twin is out in the world, and that the sacrifice by the elders was just a delusion of his. He travels the world, spending his time searching futilely for his lost twin.
