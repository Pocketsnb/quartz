# Loud Bang
## Description

## Background
Formerly known as Clip Baa, Loud worked as a ranch hand for George Shepherd, where he sheared sheep and butchered them for mutton and sale at the market in Arinthal. When goods were ready for sale, he would travel with a gunslinger, James Hay, who taught him much about fire arms. One day, the daughter of the ranch owner, Gwen, returned from the woods with a deep wound on her leg, saying a wild wolf attacked her.

About a month later, Gwen turned into a werewolf and killed her family, the ranch hands, and slaughtering all the sheep. Near death and being stalked by Gwen, James showed up and stopped her, but was seriously wounded himself in the processed and died.

Over the following days, Loud buried his friends and took up James' weapons, intent on hunting down Gwen and the beast that turned her. It has been 20 years and has gotten close a few times, and has saved a few people himself, but he has yet to stop them completely.

## Misc Notes
**Personality Traits:** It doesn’t matter if the whole world’s against me. I’ll always do what I think is right.
**Ideals:** Obsession. I’ve lived this way for so long that I can’t imagine another way.
Promise. My life is no longer my own. I must fulfill the dream of someone who’s gone.

**Bonds:** Someone I love has become a monster, murderer, or other threat. It’s up to me to redeem them.

**Flaws:** I’m convinced something is after me, appearing in mirrors, dreams, and places where no one could.
