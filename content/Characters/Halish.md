# Halish
Halish (he/him) goes by Halish (like delish). Being an iruxi, he finds it tedious to provide greater context with “of Sallowshore”. Where else would he be from?
## Description
Halish is an iruxi standing 6'7", with orange skin, dark red osteoderm, and yellow eyes. Bony, ebon protrusions frame his eyes, and make up the color of his claws and talons. Framing his head is a frill of skin. His tail is fat, striped orange and black. He's adorned with a simple shirt of chainmail with a leather shoulder pad on the left side and metal kneecaps. His wrists are wrapped in cuffs made of small bones. Under the chain is cyan padding stained black. A simple, long scarf of the same coloring adorns his neck, the two tails flowing backwards. On his waist is a sack that looks filled with many long objects pushing on the sacks edges. Strapped to his back is a scythe, also of simple make.
## Background
Born to a small clutch in Sallowshore on the eastern coast of Geb, Halish often got in spats with his sister that his aunts and uncles often broke up. In their adolescence, during one particularly violent fight, Halish killed his sister and ate her flesh, but still keeps her bones as a memento. 

When he grew older, he was employed as a gardener for Tobias Highridge, the city's ruler. However, he had a penchant for eating the garden's plants and was eventually fired for eating Tobias' deceased wife's favorite flowers. To pay recompense, he was forced into work as a laborer for the Builders League, shoring up the flooded half of the city and setting posts in the water to prepare for new construction. He didn't see much point to the work, and even thought Geb wasn't all that great, till the Celebrants came by one day and dragged him to a church of Urgathoa where he feasted for three days. There he learned that if there are more undead there are more people to produce food. He's since become a cleric of hers, a supporter of Geb, helper of the undead, and eating whatever his appetite desires. 

One day, when speaking of his philosophy on food, Berline Haldoli,the Blood Lord residing in Graydurge, overheard and took Halish in as a pupil. Halish now spends his time feasting, assisting the Celebrants, distributing food to the hungry, making sure the undead working the fields have everything they need, and learning about ways to produce food.

In the future, Halish hopes to see a Geb as the top produce of food in all of Golarion, but in the short term, to never be hungry, to always eat with “family”, and hopefully eat a dinosuar™.

## Personality
- Halish sees himself as a philosopher and gourmand. He thinks his idea of “a bowl for every hand, and a hand for every mouth” is quite something, and enjoys food, especially if he can eat something unusual.
- Others see Halish as an imposing, kind, and well meaning iruxi. It seems his appetite is never satiated, but he can’t stand to see someone not eat, and will get them food.
- Halish understands that it takes others to do big things. Without others, who would tend the fields, cook the food, and serve it?
- Halish’s greatest strength is the “compassion” of sharing a meal. His greatest weakness being his often single-minded pursuit of food.
- Food is the thing that matters the most to Halish, being able to eat as much as he wants, and seeing others do the same.
## Misc Notes
- Carries the bones of his adolescent sister (Hasty) in a sack on his hip. He places this sack in a seat next to him when dining, sharing food from the two plates. He loves his sister, even if she doesn't speak much anymore.
- Adventures with people to eat with "family" and gather more food. Easier to take down prey with more people.
- Often feasting and celebrating Geb, feeding the hungry, and ensuring the undead working the fields are in top condition.
- Philosophizes that, if there are more people, more food can be made.
- Supports Geb, because of the feasts, even if he's a scary ghost.
### Dislikes
- Picky eaters: It's good, why are they not eating?
- Loneliness: No family to share a meal with outside Sallowshore.
- Incorporeal creatures: You can't eat them, and they sometimes eat non-physical things???
- The color yellow: The argument that lead to him killing his sister was over the color of his eyes. She insisted "they're yellow, the same as mine" 
### Fears
- Starvation: Without food, he can't eat and enjoy, and he'd just wither away...
- Geb (The Ruler): While the celebrations are about him, he's still a ghost, the biggest thing under Urgathoa.
- Clouds/Fog: What are they doing up there? Why do they choose to block the stars? Do they eat? Why do they come down sometimes??
### Goals
- Eat a "dinosaur". Something big, imposing, and leathery/scaly.
- Share a meal with a priest of Pharasma. I eat them, they eat me, I eventually turn them into undead.
- Gather wealth. With wealth, you can purchase exotic foods and hire servants to feed you.
- Wake up, eat, sleep, repeat.
- Learn how to improve the soil of Geb so it can produce a variety of food from all of Golarion.
- Make Geb the largest food producer and exporter in all of Golarion.
- After second death, feast in what he imagines is the long table of Urgathoa.
