# Artifact Collector
## Description

## Background
Three hundred years ago, my family made a pact with a devil to gain power and influence as a noble house. An ancient contract was created, requiring each generation to supply them with three magical artifacts. Failing to recover the artifacts would result in all blood relatives to die with their, and all passed relatives, souls to be consigned to hell.

Since, my family has fallen from nobility and we now live humbly on a farm. Passed down through the generations is a ledger containing the contract, a listing of all artifacts retrieved, and the ritual to send the artifacts away.

During this generation, my sister successfully recovered one artifact before disappearing, along with the ledger.
