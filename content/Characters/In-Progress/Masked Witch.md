# Masked Witch

## Description
Kioo Kinyago is an Alijae elf from a small village on the outskirts of Buyisela.
His nearest family dead, and an ancestor as a Patron, Kioo has been sponsored by his village to attend Magaambya, furthering his education.
He wears a leather cloak dyed a deep red, dark orange fingerless gloves, and loose layers of cloth, colored pale yellows and greens. He keeps his genealogy mask on his chest, and other, smaller masks, adorn his personage, depicting various animals, humans, and demons.
### Personality
Kioo is reserved in his speech, but quick to accept help from others. 
He carries a small doll of a demonic form with him.
### Specialty
Kioo specializes in obscure lore, centered around spirits and crystals.
### Notable Skills
Mask crafting he picked up while apprenticing under his father.
### Hobbies
Cooking, specifically stew recipes from his grandmother.
### Strangest Quirk
He speaks with his doll as if it were a real person and can answer.
## Background
### Childhood
Kioo Kinyago grew up in a small village on the outskirts of Buyisela. During his childhood, he'd sit around the fire while his grandmother cooked, holding a doll in the shape of the Redeemer Queen, and listen to tales of his ancestors.
### Adolescence
In addition to training in the Proving during this time, Kioo assisted his father, a skilled mask carver, in his work. He also attended worship with his mother of the Redeemer Queen.
### Coming of Age
His father had developed a way of channeling memories of ancestors not recorded. By utilizing the Nahyndrian crystals, he could reach out to the spirits of blood relatives and their most prominent memories in life. Unfortunately, a flaw in one of the crystals resulted in this killing most living relatives and storing their memories as well.
### Adulthood
Studying where his father left off, Kioo was able to pull the memories of one of his ancestors from the mask, forming a more permanent emission, Upinde Mchawi. Upinde became Kioo's patron, assisting them with magic, and animating his old doll of the Redeemer Queen. His village, acknowledging his talent, sponsored his admission to the Magaambya.

### Nahyndrian crystals
Nocticula’s double‑edged gifts to the Alijae elves are known as Nahyndrian crystals,  dark‑purple stones formed from the blood of a murdered demon lord. Once common on Nocticula’s domain of the Midnight Isles in the Abyss, a number of these crystals appear to have migrated into Nocticula’s pyramid in the Mwangi Expanse. Though the crystals contain incredible power within them, the Alijae have yet to discover how to tap into them safely—uncovering the secrets behind these artifacts will take much more research, likely in distant reaches more familiar with the risen Nocticula and her past victims.
### The Redeemer Queen
Nocticula’s ascension has caused a great stir both among the Alijae elves and the demons of the Abyss, as it proves that nothing is so corrupted that it can’t be absolved. Some fiends in Nagisa might be tempted by a different life, but convincing anyone of a fiend’s sincerity is a daunting task.
### Winter Solstice
Alijae commemorate the winter solstice and remember the lives of those who have left this world behind by gathering to tell stories and share a hibiscus-flavored mead. When there is no one to share with or no access to the mead (rarely found outside the Mwangi Expanse), any mead or beer will do, and most believe their ancestors won’t mind stories shared with
outsiders that don’t reveal too much. If an elf believes the ancestors would prefer their stories not be told to those who are not Alijae, writing the stories down or repeating them quietly also fulfills the need.
### Magaambya Questions
#### Who are you?
Kioo Kinyago. I am Alijae.
#### What most interests you?
Umm, the crystals, Nahyndrian crystals. There is much unknown about them, and I believe much use can be found if their secrets can be unlocked.
#### What do you consider your greatest strength?
Those who have stood before me and lift me up.
#### What work have you done to bolster those in and around the Magaambya before now?
I suppose nothing directly, but, I'm skilled in the carving of masks, so I'm sure I can be of some help.
#### What do you seek at the Magaambya?
Knowledge relating to crystals and the blood of demons. With that knowledge, I'm sure I could assist my people in freeing Nagisa.
#### Once you have attained that which you seek, what goals do you wish to achieve?
Oh, the clearing of Nagisa and establishing it as a true city for all elves once more.
#### No, but really, who are you and how best can you be guided to grow?
I'm a helper, I suppose. The better I know a thing, the better I can help others.
