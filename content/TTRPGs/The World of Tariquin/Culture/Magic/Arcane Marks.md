## Arcane Marks
Each practitioner of arcane magic has a specific symbol that identifies them. By casting prestidigitation, a caster may create this symbol for others to see. Those who view a mark created by the caster are able to identify the mark in the future, and if they remember it, may use the mark as a focus to contact or scry upon the associated marks creator. Second hand creations are difficult though not impossible to forge, but do not bestow the same knowledge as those created by the owner themselves.

#### Bards
A bards arcane mark is often a birthmark, faint until they heed the calling of performance.

#### Sorcerers
Those with innate magical talent are born with a birthmark, often faint until their potential in casting is discovered.

#### Warlocks
Branded by their masters, warlocks have a scar upon their person that is always present, even through illusions and healing.

#### Wizards
Upon learning their first spell, a wizard realizes what their arcane mark is, and often have it tattooed upon themselves as a sign of pride for their efforts.
