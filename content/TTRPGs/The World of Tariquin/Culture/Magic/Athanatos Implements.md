# Athanatos Implements
A text created by the historian Athanatos prior to the formation of the Kingdom of the Diamond Throne. _The Implements of the World_ describes a collection of great weapons, armor, and items, each powerful in magic.

## Agent of the Gift
### Description
This longsword forged of mythral in a wavy ribbon like pattern, with three red wavy lines of powdered ruby fused into grooves that glow with a dull light like a burning ember. The cross-guard is a triangular piece of reddened metal, with the hilt a flattened cylinder of the same wrapped in thick wires of a vibrant blue color.

### History
It is not known when this weapon was created, but a weapon matching its description is mentioned in a short (and bad) poem dating to before the rise of The Sealed Tome as being owned by a half-elven bard. The poem states a group of raiders attacked the ancient elven city of Hafr'wio and took the sword as loot. Later traded to a merchant in the Sozlama Hills for a handful of slaves, the merchant then gave the sword to his son as a wedding gift. A few years later, the son lost it in a mageduel to a noble in what is now Daramir, who disappeared from history shortly after. During the rise of Kurash, the weapon is rediscovered in a dungeon lair of undead spellcasters, previous allies of The Sealed Tome, and has not been seen since.

### Powers
This +1 longsword's most unusual ability of the weapon is to imbue a target with the ability to cast a spell of 0 or 1st level. All spells imbued to the target are temporarily unavailable to the wielder of Agent of Gift. For example, a 3rd-level wizard could use the weapon to imbue his rogue ally with a magic missile spell, and would not be able to prepare a 1st-level spell in that slot until the rogue had cast the spell or was slain. Another example is a 4th-level sorcerer who uses one of his 1st-level spell slots to imbue his druid ally with a mage armor spell, and cannot use that slot until the druid casts the spell or dies. The weapon can do this once per day, and theoretically a spellcaster could imbue all of his or her spells into other targets over the course of several days and would be unable to cast spells until one of the targets expended a spell or died.

### Location
Its current whereabouts unknown, it is believed to be somewhere within the Imperium of Life.

## Axe of the Dwarvish Lords
## Grost's Pouch
### Description
This simple pouch made of soft, supple white bark has the smell of green wood. A woven strand of green moss, acts as its tie, stronger than its appearance. The bag weighs approximately 3 pounds. Within, a variety of acorns of different colors can be seen and retrieved.
### History
The pouch was formed from the bark of a lightning-split oak tree by a hermit druid of The Bestial called "Old Grost" living in the Gwylit Forest. Being very territorial and likely to attack anyone he felt threatened his forest home, regardless of their race and true intentions, he crafted the pouch with his own hands and imbued it with magic--some believe a part of his spirit lingers in the pouch. He was found dead in his tree-house by another Gwylit druid named Shandri Four-Splinters who took the pouch to her circle and was told she should keep it. For the next three months she experimented with it and composed a letter to her circle superior detailing its powers but never got to send it; she was found dead in the forest by a group of Golden Dawn Adventurers (the Company of the Blue Shadow). The adventurers believe she was attacked by some strange intelligent beast, as her wounds were caused by weapons and claws; the pouch was missing (as was all of her magical gear) but her letter describing its abilities was still in its scroll tube.

A few years later, a traveling bard (Helm "Songbreaker" Dundragon) spoke of a strange sight in Gwylit Forest, four snakes with glowing eyes flying eastward in a pattern around a white textured pouch, as if carried by an invisible air elemental, and The Bestial's church believes that pouch was Grost's Pouch.

Later, a westbound caravan from Suurjaht suffered an attack from a strange menagerie of animals lead by a wild elf with numerous scars, carrying a white pouch in one hand, casting acorns forth from it with the other. Upon striking the ground, the acorns sprouted into animals. Before all the caravan defenders were slain by the never ending array of animals, he called an end to the attack and pulled his warriors back into the safety of the night and forest. This unknown elf has been seen at least two other times since then, and rumors say he is a servant of a young green dragon (known only as "Elfdrinker" and "Scourbreath" to those in the Gwylit) being groomed for dracolichdom or perhaps vampirism by the Cult of the Dragon.

### Powers
By reaching into the pouch, the person attuned can retrieve one of many colorful acorns. As an action, an acorn can be pulled from the pouch and thrown up to 20 ft. When it lands, it transforms into a creature determined by the acorns color and a d4 roll. See the Monster Manual for the creature's statistics. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.

Only three acorns of each color are within the pouch during a period, and refills once a week. Additionally, the owner of the pouch is under the effects of the pass without trace spell.

## The Bloodmask of Cardin
### Description
The Bloodmask of Cardin is a leathery red mask with demonic features. The eye brows and cheek bones are ridged to enhance the ominous appearance of the mask. The eye holes are slightly slanted and a single slit for the mouth gives the mask a grim demeanor. Three black scars extend from the upper left and diminish as they cross the face. Close inspection of the leather reveals that the mask is made from the skin of a man. It is held to the face by three leather straps that wrap around the head.

### History
The Bloodmask of Cardin would be more appropriately named the bloodmask made from Cardin. Its grim story is rooted to a conflict between good and evil that laid waste to a small community on Kault. The elven cleric of The Huntress, Cardin, was known to have fought and slain many agents of evil throughout his long life. None however were as vile as the great Pit Fiend, Fregartru. In Cardins early years, when he was strong in body and faith, he banished the demon back to the pits of hell. The battle had been fierce and had nearly destroyed a small elven village whose name has been lost to time. The battle sent the pit fiend reeling into the Abyss with three dark scars across his face where Cardin had blinded his right eye.

The banishment of Fregartru was a short reprieve in the lives of the elf and the demon. Nearly three hundred years passed by until their next fateful encounter. Cardin, now a wizened elven sage, was called to the to investigate a loss of contact with the small village he had saved 300 years before. His heart sank as the small village was discovered in ruin. The bodies of the elves hung lifeless upon spears that held them in the air, their heads removed. In the center of town, waiting patiently upon a throne made from the heads of elves, sat Fregartru. His horrid face still showed the signs of the three scars that Cardin had dealt to him hundreds of years before. Cardin stood his ground and faced the demon, proudly calling forth the powers of his goddess. But Fregartru had grown in power since their last encounter and Cardin found himself unable to stop the demonic minion of evil. Cardin died to the razor sharp claws of the mighty pit fiend. He tore Cardins head from his skull and used it to forge a mask. Cardins skin was used, sewn to form a hideous mask that the Pit Fiend wore upon his face. The mask was blood red and had many of the angular features of the pit fiends face. Over the years, the three scars that Fregartru attempted to hide with his mask began to emerge on the mask as three black scars. The process drove the mighty fiend insane for he believed the dead spirit of Cardin was attempting to humiliate him once more.

Appalled by the chaotic actions of one of their own, several pitfiends banned together and destroyed Fregartru. Unable to destroy his unholy possessions, they cast them from their plane to the world of mortals.

### Powers
The Bloodmask of Cardin has an evil presence to it and will cause a severe headache to any good aligned priest or paladin attempting to wear it. The Bloodmask of Cardin is known to possess the following powers:

- +2 armor enhancement
- Resistance to fire based attacks
- Additional proficiency bonus when using skills vs. evil creatures
- Advantage to intimidate checks and disadvantage to all persuasion checks.

The mask also has a limited form of regeneration. As long as the character is alive, the mask will restore 5 hit points one round after combat has ended.

### Location
The Bloodmask of Cardin came to rest upon Kault when it was cast out by the fiends. An elven vampire by the name of Thymran found the mask, though it’s current whereabouts are unknown.

## Culler of Chaff
### Description
Despite its great age, this scythe has smooth and polished wood that remains green and supple, and even smells freshly-cut. The blade is simple and unadorned. The shaft of the weapon is covered in a small hedge of brown thorny growth; if the weapon is picked up the growth bends and slides away from the handles, never harming the creature carrying or wielding it. If cut or burned, the thorns slowly grow back over the course of a week (this does not affect the powers of the weapon).

### History
Its origins are unknown, though it was first spotted in the Ojo Islands, and it carries some mystery with it for it has a habit of disappearing when it would become lost and being found when it is needed. Several myths of the Goddess The Tamed tell of its wielder overwhelmed by evil forces but when the body is recovered the Culler is nowhere to be found. Other stories tell of a lone cleric of The Tamed, or humble farmer pursued by orcs, lycanthropes, or other hostiles, who stumbles into a small clearing to find Culler of Chaff standing upright as if it had sprouted there, and with the help of the weapon the follower of The Tamed survives the enemy attack. Because of this ability it has been found in such far-distant places as Kault and Pela Islands. Despite multiple divinations and attempts to activate this rumored power (presumably to carry its wielder to another location), no hard evidence of it can be found.

### Powers
In addition to its primary use as a +2 holy scythe, the scythe is treated as living wood. Any effect that would distort it or alter its shape (such as warp wood) affect it normally, though it reverts to its normal form after one day. Once per day the wielder may use it to create a wall of thorns. Alternately, the wielder may use that ability to create a thorny covering over her own body; these thorns allow her to deal damage while grappling as if she was wearing spiked armor (1d4 piercing). She is treated as armed when making unarmed attacks (dealing 1d6 piercing damage). Creatures grappling you suffer 2 points of damage with each successful grapple attack they make. You act as if you are proficient in these thorns (whether using melee attacks or as "armor spikes"). If the bearer ever loses contact with the scythe the thorny covering vanishes instantly (but the bearer could hold the weapon with one hand, like a staff, and still make attacks with her free hand). The thorns never interfere with the wielder's actions and do not prevent her from casting spells; she can even touch creatures without harming them (even to the extend of riding a horse bareback, the thorns move to accommodate friendly contact).

### Location
Last seen being used in Kalashet, it's current location is unknown.

## Cutter
### Description
Cutter is a longsword, forged of adamantium, giving it purple veins along its darkened edge. Along the blade is etched "Cutter" in ancient Delzoun dwarven runes, only discernible when the blade is coated in blood. The hilt is wrapped in the tanned hide of a spined devil. When drawn, the sword can be felt faintly vibrating.

### History
Crafted after the first demon war by a Delzoun blacksmith, Cutter gained sentience shortly after being crafted, the spirit of the creature wrapping its handle seemingly finding refuge within the blade. It's first owner found themselves running through a flaming forest and into archer fire before finally drowning in a river.

### Powers
Cutter is an Intelligent Lawful Evil longsword +3. When an inanimate object is attacked and hit with Cutter, maximum damage is dealt to the target. When attacking a creature, on a roll of 20 the target takes an additional 20 slashing damage. The attacker then rolls a second d20. If the second attack hits, one of the targets limbs is removed (effect of such a loss determined by the DM). If the creature has no limb to sever, a portion of its body is removed instead.

With its sentience, Cutter has the following ability scores: Int 11, Wis 14, Cha 8. The blade communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and can hear and see out to a range of 120 ft, and urges its wielder to use it in every battle, regardless of distance or obstacles to the target.

### Location
Currently kept within the treasure troves of Citadel Olgen.

## Decanter of Turmoil
### Description
This rust colored decanter is made of clay carved from Dagon's palace on the ocean floor of the Shadowsea, one of the layers of the Abyss. It's exterior has a depiction of a great mawed serpent coiling around it's base to the mouth piece, painted with black ash. By drinking from this decanter, the imbiber gains insight and powers beyond the mortal realms, is driven mad, and eventually commits suicide.

### History
Though it's exact origins are unknown, it is believed the decanter was fired in a kiln near where The Imprisoned One is kept, infusing the mad gods essence within, and given to The Inner Turmoil as a gift. However, the decanter was soon stolen by The Traveler and lost on the material plane after a raucous party. Believed to be an influence in the division of the Exeger Empire in 220 GD, no definitive appearances are found.

### Powers
Upon drinking from the decanter, the imbiber must rolls d%, the result being how many months before madness overtakes them and they commit suicide. They also gain the use of following abilities a total of 3 times per day, recharging daily at dawn. Each use of an ability reduces remaining months by one.

_Command._ The imbiber can use an action to command another creature to flee or grovel, as with the command spell (save DC 15).
_Wave of Terror._ Each creature in a 30-foot radius extending from the imbiber must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
_Wild Shape._ The imbiber can assume the form of a pitch colored Lindwurm (ToB pg. 276) for up to 5 hours. The imbiber can revert to their normal form earlier by using a bonus action on their turn. They automatically revert if they fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die (see PHB. pg. 66 "Wild Shape" for additional rules).
_Foresight._ The imbiber gains the effects of the foresight spell.

Once drunk from, the decanter does not grant these powers to any other until the the previous imbiber dies.

### Location
Last seen in the ownership of Proclin within Stracili.

## Druniazth
### Description
Druniazth is a magical bastard sword. Its blade is a dark purple metal that emanates a chilling aura while unsheathed, with its handle covered in runes protecting its wielder from the cold.

### History
Druniazth was forged from what is believed to be one of The Imprisoned One's teeth and is one of the most powerful artifacts associated with that deity. Druniazth serves as a bridge between the Material Plane and the elder gods prison, providing a window to the soul of the god, and through it he tries to obtain his freedom.

The sword was created by the Dreamers of Freedom, the followers of The Imprisoned One, and though when it was created is unknown, it is believed to have been created before the nation of Ogrom was formed.

The swords first documented appearance was in the -210 GD, when Lum the Mad brandished it against sorcerers of the Exeger Empire at the sourthern edge of the Gwylit Forest, where he was slain. The weapon then changed hands several times before being lost again, until it was discovered in 570 GD within a hidden temple to The Imprisoned One within the Serpentspine Mountains, by a half-elf named Nizar Drav'va. Slowly becoming mad from contact with the sword, Nizar was later found dead on the streets of Agoneploda, the sword nowhere to be found but believed to have been in the possession of the thieves guild.

### Powers
Druniazth is a +3 bastard sword that grants its wielder resistance to cold and fire damage. While unsheathed, a chilling aura extends from the blade, extinguishing all nonmagical flames within 30 feet. While in freezing temperatures, the blade glows with a bright light in a 10-foot radius, and a dim light for an additional 10 feet.

Targets struck by the weapon only regain hit points through a short or long rest, not through regeneration, magic, or any other means, and take an additional 1d6 cold damage. Once per turn, when a creature is struck by the weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time it's been wounded. The creature then makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself with a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.

The wielder and creatures wounded by the blade that take a long rest must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion as they see visions and nightmares of The Imprisoned One thrashing within his prison.

### Location
The sword was last seen in the hands of a half elf named Nizar Drav'va within the ancient city of Agoneploda.

## Eye and Hand of Vecna
See DMG pg. 224.

## Force of Wrath
### Description
This warhammer has a thick wooden handle wrapped in dark leather at its base. the head appears to be a block of solid, pocked stone, eternally stained with blood. If wielded by a raging barbarian, the head shifts into a block of rusty iron sharpened on both ends to rend flesh from bone.

### History
Worshiped by several clans of barbarians, Force of Wrath was crafted during the age of the necromancer kings as one of many foci to draw all emotion from those around it. As the citizens of the various cities found their emotions drained, they became angry, eventually rioting and destroying the other foci but missing this one. As the riots continued, Force of Wrath was the sole channel of all the rage and hate, eventually becoming sentient. Later found within a set of ruins by an adventuring party on their return to the coast of Kault, it was lost in battle to a barbarian raid, where it's stayed within the clans ever since.

### Powers
This intelligent +2 warhammer has a critical threat range of 19-20, with an Intelligence of 14, Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 16. Once per day as decided by the DM, Force of Wrath attempts to drive its wielder into a terrible rage (Charisma save DC 13). While raging, the wielder gains the following benefits.

- Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When making a melee weapon attack using Strength, gain a +3 bonus to the damage rolls.
- Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If the wielder is able to cast spells, they cannot cast them or concentrate on them while raging. The rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if the wielder is knocked unconscious or no creatures are within 30 feet. If there are no enemies within range, the wielder will turn on their allies.

Force of Wrath communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature wielding it, though subtle variations of anger. It's able to hear and see out to 30 ft. and is chaotic neutral, often goading its owner to fight arbitrary battles.

### Location
Last seen held by the barbarian leaders of Katai's Maw in Kault.

## Gems of The Imprisonment
### Description
These gems of various size have concentric banding of different colors in a circular pattern, with a combination of translucent agates in a purplish rose gray and dark black brown center. each of these gems are carved into a sphere with a point on either end, creating the illusion of an eye.

### History
There are 333 in collection of gems known as the Gems of Imprisonment. Forged by an unknown source, these gems are said to be the key to freeing the dark god from his prison. It is believed the clerics of The Imprisoned One began to pilfer his hoard of beautiful gems when all attempts to resurrect the god failed; 333 gems of utmost value, ranging in worth from 5,000 to 50,000 gold pieces each. The former servants of this deity slipped away with their great wealth to serve other gods and wreak evil elsewhere.

### Powers
Each gem grants the holder one temporary hit point that adds to the same pool of temporary hit points together (controlling two gems grants 2 temporary hp, three gems 3 temporary hp, etc.). These temporary hit points are regenerated at the end of a long rest. Additionally, the owner is subtly guided towards gathering the other gems.

### Location
While I have come across reports of some of these gems locations, the author finds it irresponsible to compile a list of such a potentially dangerous object.

## Glorious Victory
### Description
The haft of this hammer is made of mythrawood banded with iron. the head is wide and inscribed with the symbol of The Endless Battle inlaid with a red enamel.

### History
Previously carried by a young devotee of The Coming Storm, after several successful battles as part of a mercenary company he became an adventurer. This unknown young hero eventually become a divine champion of his faith imbuing the hammer with powerful magic. When the hero was slain in battle with duergar in the Underdark, one of the gray dwarves claimed the weapon and had his brother further enchant it to crave the blood of humans. The hammer was eventually given to the leader of the duergar clan to pay a debt. That leader had the weapon stolen from his trove by an adventuring orcish rogue, who sold the weapon to the high priest of The Endless Battle, where it was blessed to grant additional health to the wielder. Since that time it has been carried by several favored orcs of the one eyed god.

### Powers
Glorious Victory is a +2 warhammer. When a human is hit with this weapon, the human takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. When a human is struck by the weapon, the wielder regains half the damage dealt in temporary hit points. While attuned to the weapon, the wielder gains 2 additional hit points for each level attained.

### Location
Carried among the orcs of the Sozlama Hills.

## Glory of Gold
### Description
Crafted from a sheep's hide, these supple gloves have golden thread embroidered around the wrist and spiral patterns over the finger pads that thread to the palm.

### History
Crafted prior to the fall of the Exeger Empire at the behest of a wealthy cloth merchant. To help himself and his heirs conduct business better, he had the church of The Traveler embroider the gloves with powers to help negotiation and recognize inferior goods. Unfortunately his son invested much of the family's money in an expedition into the to the Ojo Islands, which fell apart before ever reaching that land's shores and he had to sell the gloves in order to keep the family businesses running. A half elf from the Myhtrawood forest purchased the gloves and used its powers to help increase his family's wealth, and when a business rival proved troublesome he had the gloves enchanted with additional abilities to help his younger brother, an aspiring thief, steal documents of land ownership from the rival's family. The thief hit some bad luck during the attempt and was killed; the rival wore the gloves as a trophy thereafter. In recent years, the elderly but still spry rival traveled to the Pela Islands to conduct a business deal, and presumably was captured or imprisoned.

### Powers
The gloves automatically size themselves to fit any race from a halfling to a giant, and when worn they grant a +5 bonus on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand), Charisma (Persuasion) checks. Additionally, the thread along the wrist can be pulled out creating a silk rope 50 feet in length for 3 hours before the thread reappears in the glove. The wearer can store an object of no more of 5 lbs. in weight within the palm in an extra-dimensional space, and recollect the object by snapping their fingers.

### Location
Last seen on the hands of a merchant traveling to the Pela Islands.

## Hawkwing
### Description
Carved from mythrawood, each arm of this weapon resembles a thin wing of a hawk, stained in a mottled brown coloring.

### History
When entering into a deep trance with the help of a dream sphere, Kavior D'Altera scavenged the corpses of old gods and learned how to perfectly carve a weapon to last the ages. Choosing a limb from a great tree deep within the mythrawood forest, he carved Hawkwing and gave it to his son, Redair. Kavior proceeded to delve within deep trances, seeking more and more knowledge, and while doing so, Redair would stand vigilant, protecting his father from the swarms of otherworldly beings seeking to rend Kavior apart.

Hearing of the possible knowledge gainable from the dream sphere, a great red dragon, Vassasuvian, took interest, and attacked the pair. Kavior was slain, but Redair survived, heading back to the more civilized elven lands. There, Redair went under the name Erreshi, and became one of the lords guarding Huore'ailo from the hordes of undead that swept across the lands. Before his death, Kavior set out to the east, seeking Vassusuvian for vengence, leaving his posessions and lands to his general.

### Powers
Hawkwing is a +1 longbow, and grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When attuned, once every 24 hours at night, the wielder of Hawkwing can choose a creature type, when 20 is rolled on an attack against a creature of the specified type, it must succeed a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.

Additionally, while attuned, when making a ranged attack, the owner can use the command phrase "Swift death to you who have wronged me." The target of the attack becomes the owners sworn enemy until they die, or dawn seven days later. Only one enemy can be the sworn enemy at a time. Attack rolls against the sworn enemy have advantage, the sworn enemy does not gain benefit from cover, other than total cover, and the owner does not suffer disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, the sworn enemy takes an additional 3d6 piercing damage.

While the sworn enemy lives, the owner has disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.

### Location
Last seen leaving Huore'ailo east towards Vassasuvian, a red dragon.

## Icebreaker
(Cloak of the Manta Ray) (Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals) (Cap of Water Breathing) (Mariner's Armor) (Ring of Water Elemental Command)

Courtesy Sean K Reynolds:
**Air Walker:** This _+1 dancing greatsword_ is an old weapon, made of textured steel and with a gold hilt and crossguard. Shaundakul's old symbol (an upright hand surrounded by swirling winds) adorns the blade in purple. Like many greatswords, _Air Walker_ has no point, as it is intended as a slashing weapon and is difficult to use for thrusting attacks unless used by a larger-than-human creature.  
  
    By no coincidence it resembles the god's own weapon _Sword of Shadows_, for after the fall of Myth Drannor the god's avatar battled the many fiends that took up residence in that place, and in one such battle a sliver of metal was sheared from his blade by the attack of a balor. This sliver was found by Maxivaen Dundragos, a member of his surviving clergy, and Maxivaen's church used the metal as the seed for a weapon they hoped would bolster the courage of the remaining faithful. Guided by lingering power in the godsblade fragment, the priests finished the basic crafting and then set about pouring as much magic into it as they could muster. The result was a _+1 dancing greatsword_ that resembled that of their patron. Rallying behind their weapon of hope, the Shaundakun gathered adventurers from the nearby lands and attacked Myth Drannor. Three times these sorties were all but destroyed, and three times they retreated, gathered more forces, and returned to battle. The fourth time they never returned, and among the  dead were Maxivaen himself.  
  
    At some point the weapon was looted from the lost city by someone who didn't know or care about its heritage, for it was discovered in the Caverns of the Claw in the hands of a particularly nasty troll barbarian in 1105 DR. The woman who found it, a human of unknown heritage named Divaelin Santori, brought it to a temple of Waukeen to have it crafted with more power, as she had grown wealthy cleaning up after other adventuring groups who almost succeeded in their missions to wipe out monster colonies. When the Waukeenar clerics finished, they told her with surprise and chagrin that despite their attempts to add the _mighty cleaving_ property to it, the weapon emerged bearing the ability to make its wielder assume _gaseous form_. From what the clerics were able to determine, there is a vestigial intelligence in the sword that guides what magic is placed into it. The intelligence has made no attempts to communicate and may not be able to, but it can warp spells poured into it to give its metal body the powers _it_ wants.  
  
    Divaelin accepted this change with aplomb and used the weapon to carve out a small territory for herself in the Border Kingdoms. When she grew old her fiefdom collapsed under the attack of a wizard neighbor, and the weapon disappeared for over 200 years. It was discovered again by Vugruk Firetongue, a half-orc follower of Shaundakul, who would not say where he got it (but as he bore horrible acid scars all over his left arm around the time he reappeared with the weapon and was reputed to be exploring the Underdark, it is likely he found it in the hands of a cult of Ghaunadaur or similar faith). Vugruk swore to bring the truth of Shaundakul's nature to the "savages of the Great Desert who have succumbed to Beshaba's lies." The last report of him comes from a Zhent Anauroch caravan scout, who saw a half-orc with a greatsword surrounded by dead half-fiendish creatures and battling a demonic-looking mauve scorpion. Scholars of Shaundakul's church have triangulated the general location of the battle, but recent scrying attmepts to find it have been thwarted by large hemispherical areas of shadow.  
  
    _Air Walker_ lets is bearer assume _gaseous form_ once per day (caster level 5). The rudimentary intelligence in the weapon occassionally manifests itself by invoking this power when the bearer is incapacitated, bearing him or her to a place of safety within range. Other times it has actiated the _dancing_ ability of the weapon after its bearer has fallen, allowing for one last stand before the final end, in hopes of slaying as many enemies as possible. It is not known what other properties the weapon wants to have or if it has any other secret abilities.

"    **Harsh Mistress:** This _+1 frost trident_ consists of a straight piece of sea-weathered wood as its shaft, a three-pointed head of blue-green metal, and a wooden disk bearing Umberlee's symbol, all held together by a nail. The nail and tines look shiny and smooth but feel and smell rusty and pitted, and the painted symbol on the disk is old, faded, and partially worn.  
   The church of Umberlee claims the weapon was created by a half-orc pirate captain of the Nelanther Isles named Galag Lam. Lam had put his ship ashore on a small island to collect fresh fruit after a successful raid, and when he wandered away to relieve himself his crew decided to make off with the loot and his ship. Finding himself abandoned on a tiny island with only a few fruit trees and seagulls for company, he swore to the Bitch Queen that if she helped him off the island, while he hunted down his mutineeing crew he would throw overboard all booty he acquired as a sacrifice to the goddess. She guided his hand and showed him broken pieces of old things left behind on the island, fusing them into a magic weapon that would aid him. It took him seven years and many journeys by boat, caravan, and horse, but he eventually found every single sailor who betrayed him and added their heads to his treasure offerings to Umberlee. Several times in his journeys Lam used the trident to fool his prey into thinking he was lost overboard, only to turn up later in the dark of night ready to stick _Harsh Mistress_ in someone's gut. Lam died in a brawl in 1260 DR, and since that time the weapon has passed through over a hundred pairs of hands, most of them associated with the church of Umberlee, some of which added to the trident's magic. It was last seen in Westgate in 1371 DR, carried by a woman calling herself Kern, who may have been a disguised water genasi.  
   In addition to the primary abilities mentioned above, the wielder can easily pull the nail out--causing the weapon to fall into its component pieces--or press it in place again, but the weapon shows no inclination to fall apart on its own, nor is it any more vulnerable to sundering than a normal trident. When disassembled, the weapon's pieces do not radiate magic, so it is likely this aspect was created to help smuggle the item. Dissasembling or reassembling the trident takes one full round (though the wielder can make it fall apart in a haphazard way by pulling the nail as a move action, causing the pieces to scatter in a 5-foot-square area).  
   _Harsh Mistress_ floats like an air bladder, effectively applying 300 pounds of bouyancy toward the surface when in or under water; the wielder can suppress or reactivate this ability as a free action (when unattended it defaults to floating). Because of this ability, the weapon has been "lost" at sea several times in various aquatic disasters or adventures, only to wash up on shore tendays later to be claimed by Umberlee's church.  
   When held, the weapon gives the wielder low-light vision and darkvision. It does not shed light unless the wielder wills it (a standard action to activate or deactivate), and only when on or in the sea or ocean.

## Inspired to War
Courtesy Sean K Reynolds:
"**Inspired to War:** This _+1 longsword_ is extremely old. The blade, hilt, and crossguard are made with the same metal, and the hilt is wrapped in a long folded length of simple but quality paper. When drawn, strange characters scroll across the length of the blade, spelling out the Binder's dogma in an unknown language.  
    Though it was made by human hands, its metal parts were forged in a style and with a particular kind of steel not known in Faerûn; those who have studied the blade believe it was made by some human culture from another plane and brought to Toril by some Oghma-worshipper long ago. Though its origin is lost to time, the sword has been passed from champion to diplomat to bard and so on through generations of Oghma's faith. In recent months it was held at the Leaves of Learning (a temple and library of Oghma in Highmoon), used by the temple's high priest Learned Father High Altar Hasicor Danali only for important ceremonies (as he has a personal magical weapon he prefers for actual combat, see [Leaves of Learning](https://web.archive.org/web/20160322121946/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20020529a), the web enhancement for Faiths and Pantheons). Unfortunately, in mid-Nightal 1372 Danali went to retrieve the sword and found it stolen.  
     In addition to the above abilities, _Inspired to War_ can cast a bless spell once per day. As long as it is sheathed, it gives its bearer a +5 bonus to Diplomacy checks. Once per day the bearer can unroll one piece of paper from the hilt; when unfolded, each piece is as large as a standard scroll.  
    Inspired to War is a self-identifying item that does not shed light.  
    _Caster Level:_ 10th, _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bless, glibness, fabricate, _Market Price:_ 7,815 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 4,065 gp + 300 XP. "
   

## Kiss of the Dark Spider
Courtesy Sean K Reynolds:
"    **Kiss of the Dark Spider:** This _+2 elf bane venomous rapier_  was created for Akordia Devarratin, a drow divine champion of Lolth. Captain of her temple's guards, the sister of the high priestess, and a favorite choice to lead surface raids on elven communities, Akordia fell prey to a mind flayer assassin in 765 DR, who took her weapon and sold it in one of the larger Underdark cities. The weapon was later found in 1113 DR by a group of adventurers at the heart of a chitine temple to Lolth, who worshipped the weapon as an aspect of their goddess. The weapon was claimed by the group's cleric of Waukeen, who appreciated its value rather than its functions, and was taken to her temple in Amn as a treasure item. The temple was attacked by drow in 1304 DR and its storehouse plundered, and the weapon has not been seen since.  
    _Kiss of the Dark Spider_ is a slender rapier with a basket hilt made of metallic spider legs. The blade is gray steel decorated with a delicate web pattern, with a red metal spider symbol near the hilt. The hilt made of that same red steel, with a series of black leglike arcs winding around it to enhance the grip. The end of the hilt is a black ovoid marked with the red hourglass of a black widow spider. When the weapon is grasped, the spider-legs of the basket grips the wielder's hand, giving a +10 bonus to avoid disarm attempts (as if the wielder were using a locked gauntlet). This does not stack with the effects of a locked gauntlet, but the legs release automatically whenever the wielder desires. Once per day the weapon can be commanded to _delay poison_ (at 3rd level) on the wielder. When the _venomous_ property is activated on the weapon, the wielder can have it deal Constitution damage or (in the manner of spider poison) Strength damage.  
    _Caster Level:_ 9th, _Prerequisites: delay poison_, _poison_, _summon monster I; Market Price:_ 37,820 gp_; Cost to Create:_ 19,070 gp + 1,500 XP_._"

## Mastes' Stroke
### Description
Mastes' Stroke is an elaborately handled paint brush, stylized with carvings of a variety of fantastical creatures.

### History
Mastes, a gnomish wizard, was found himself upset at the number of taxes being imposed by the local noble lord. Thinking to show what wonders could potentially be created if taxes were lowered and allowed to spend their coin in other focuses, Mastes created a brush requiring no paint to function. Mildly impressed, the lord asked if the brush could perform any other functions, sending Mastes to away to return when he could answer to the lords liking. Weeks later, Mastes returned showing the brushes new functionality, drawing symbols in midair that prevented physical matter, even air from traversing. Being slightly amused at these new developments, the lord again asked if there were any other functions, and sent Mastes away to improve upon the design. Thinking to truly wow the lord, Mastes spent the next three months carving a handle for the brushes head, imbuing within it the ability to create a variety of illusionary creatures. When summoned before the lord, Mastes drew the shape of a cats head, creating the illusion of a saber-tooth tiger, frightening the lord to death. Mastes was then arrested, his possessions confiscated, and summarily executed.

### Powers
This elaborately handled paint brush requires no paints to function. The user simply wills the brush to paint in the specified color. Once attuned, the user becomes aware of it’s other functions.

By drawing a distinct shape or figure in the air, and expending a number of charges based on the chosen shape as shown in the table, resulting in a variety of effects. The brush starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn. If the brush has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens.

If a circle, triangle, or pentagon is drawn, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to dismiss the cube, or the brush runs out of charges. You can change the barrier's effect by drawing a different shape and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration. If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can't pass through the cube, you can't move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.

You can use an action to draw a creature that appears at a point on the ground within 30 feet of you. An illusion of one or more creatures forms and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature (as presented in the Monster Manual), except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of the brush. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.

The illusion lasts until the dawn of the next day or the illusion is dispelled.

## Price of Vigilance
flaming Shield 
Courtesy Sean K Reynolds:
"    **Price of Vigilance:** This _+3 lawful defender bastard sword_ has a fairly unremarkable appearance. It is made of steel, with a crossguard and hilt made of a darker steel. The hilt is wrapped in black leather, which always has several bloodstains on it that appear to have just dried. The only truly unusual feature is the shield-like symbol on the hilt, which is made of tiny interlocking three-pointed inlays made of ivory. Some speculate that this weapon is one of three of its kind (as represented by the three points of each symbol), especially as a broken bastard sword bearing a part of this symbol was found in the hands of a dead adventurer in the Dungeon of Swords, although no trace of the rumored third weapon has even been found.  
    _Price of Vigilance_ was created somewhere in the Vilhon Reach approximately 1242 DR, and is recorded as property of a Helmite caravan guardian in Ormpetarr (Sespech) in 1244 DR, where it is listed simply as a minor _defending_ weapon. The next time the sword appears is in the logs of the mage Turinsar the White-Armed in Waterdeep, who bought it in 1301 DR from an unnamed Calishite sorcerer who reputedly took it from the hoard of a young red dragon. Turinsar noted that the weapon has three enhancement bonuses and is a _defender_ weapon. He sold the weapon in 1302 DR to Klanaus Ironhand, a cleric of Helm known for collecting and creating magic weapons sanctified to Helm. It is believed that Klanaus gave the weapon its remaining properties over the next few years, and then awarded it to Helm Graywood (another Helmite cleric) in 1355 DR as a boon for slaying a cabal of Banite clerics. He disappeared during the Time of Troubles and the weapon has not been seen since.  
    In addition to its primary properties, _The Price of Vigilance_ has the ability to cast _shield other_ once per day. If the bearer has not used this power of the sword in a while, the weapon sometimes activates this power automatically upon a worthy nearby person, forcing them to protect that person until the spell expires.  
    _Caster Level:_ 9, _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _shield_ or _shield of faith_, _order's wrath_, _shield other_, creator must be lawful,; _Market Price:_ 85,335 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 42,835 gp + 3,400 XP."

## Raven's Beak
This +2 ghost touch holy longsword was forged for Agamar of Riverwall several centuries ago. Since then, it has been wielded by a line of paladins dedicated to the destruction of the undead. The name, “Returner,” was coined by Agamar to signal his intent that the blade be used to “return those who mock life to the grave from which they arose.”  The blade is crafted of an odd, stone-like substance, similar to alabaster but as hard as the finest steel. It is dimly translucent and has a very faint luminescence when exposed to any light. This light is not enough to see by, but enough to make the blade glimmer oddly in starlight or call attention to itself in a room lit only by a single candle. The hilt is made of ivory around a steel core, and is carved with various icons representing gods of life, justice, and light. There is no scabbard specifically associated with the blade, but any scabbard used regularly slowly fades in color, becoming in time the same translucent white hue as the blade. If the Returner is wielded by a paladin, the weapon also acts as an amulet of undead turning.  When placed on an altar dedicated to any god of life, the blade changes slightly. Bright lines of energy crackle along it, and the name of each free-willed undead it has slain can be seen, written in Common, along the surface of the blade. No matter how many names appear, more may be added. The existing writing shifts, shrinks, or moves to make room for any new name to appear.  Agamar’s Returner is well known by intelligent freewilled undead. Anyone seen wielding it is immediately judged an enemy by such creatures, and a competent one at that—blades of this power rarely remain with the weak or incompetent for long. The free-willed undead carefully studies anyone bearing the Returner prior to attack. “You shall be another name on the Returner” is a common threat or warning among the undead.  Caster Level: 10th, Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift, holy smite, caster must be good and a 10th level cleric; Market Price: 64,980 gp; Cost to Create: 32,648 gp + 2,587 XP.

Radiant Maul (Gem of Brightness) (Mace of Disruption)
Courtesy Sean K Reynolds:
"    **Death's Judgement:** This _+1 undead-bane bastard sword_ is one of the first weapons sanctified in the name of the new Lord of the Dead. Created by high priest Bezurgathan Indraeyan (LN male human Clr16/Ftr1 of Kelemvor) himself with one of his lesser priests, it was originally a _+1 bastard sword_ with its secondary property (see below), and was stolen by an undead shadowdancer in the midst of a battle with a minor lich's horde of bolstered skeletons and zombies. It turned up a year later in the hands of a vampire in Westgate, who was slain by a visiting delegation of gold dwarves from the Great Rift. Considering the weapon unwieldy and of inferior workmanship, they donated it to Kelemvor's temple in Baldur's Gate in exchange for powerful healing magic. It was given the _undead bane_ property and awarded to Artun Farspeaker, a young paladin of the faith, who was lured into the Dread Lair of Alokkair a year ago and has not been since.  
    _Death's Judgement_ has a blade of mottled gray and shiny silver steel, marked with Kelemvor's symbol near the hilt. The crossguard is dark gray steel, shaped similar to the arms of a scale. The hilt is dark gray leather wrapped around a wavy shaft of metal, capped with a knob of the same metal as the crossguard.  
    In addition to its primary abilities, _Death's Judgement_ acts as an _amulet of undead turning_, allowing a cleric or paladin holding it to turn undead as if he were four levels higher than his actual class level (it does not help rebuke or command undead). The weapon sheds pale white light automatically for one minute after touching an undead creature, but otherwise does not shed light.  
    _Caster Level:_ 10th, _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous Item, _summon monster I_, creator must be a 10th-level cleric; _Market Price:_ 30,335 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 15,335 gp + 1,200 XP."

## Scorpion Crown
An artifact of Tharizdun. The Scorpion Crown is a cursed item, that such any living mortal who wears it turns into undead – a lich or vampire.  The wearer of the Crown gains the power to command the undead to do his bidding.  The Crown has a connection to mysterious Atropus, the Evil Moon.

Courtesy of Wizards:
The final doom of the Sulm came suddenly, when its last rulerâ€”a mad sorcerer named Shattodosâ€”was granted a boon from his divine patron, Tharizdun. The dark god's gift took the form of a powerful artifact called the _Scorpion Crown,_ which promised to allow Shattados's true and everlasting dominion over all of his subjects. What it did was transform almost all of Sulm's people into hideous manscorpions bound to Shattados, and precipitated the eventual decline of the Sulm's lush grasslands to a wasteland of sand and rock.

## Spear of Sorrow
An artifact of Tharizdun. An enchanted polearm, with a shaft made from the tree of Midgard, and a mithril blade forged from the hellfire of Baator, and mounted on a skull, the is the primary weapon of Slothragoth the Skull Lord, who is Tharizdun’s Exarch and Marshal of his undead armies.  The weapon emits a magical spell that anyone caught in its path is trapped in an illusion of self-loathing and sorrow.

Courtesy of Wizards:
Since Ivid was first led here a century and a half ago, mages and priests in the service of the Naelax overkings have come to craft artefacts of great power and woe to further their masterâ€™s tyrannical ends. Among the best known of these is the _Spear of Sorrow,_ a seven-foot-long barbed spear shaped from the black stone of the Cauldron by Karoolk, last Court Archmage of Ivid V. The spear was last seen in the hands of General Kalreth of Permanence, the man who crushed the army of Osson of Almor and meted out the overkingâ€™s vengeance on the See of Medegia, leaving it the devastated sword land it is today. Mercifully, both Kalreth and the Spear vanished at the time of Rauxesâ€™ fall and it is thought (and hoped) that the general was lost along with his master, Ivid V, in whatever disaster overcame the city.

## Sword of Kas
See DMG pg. 226.

## Talons of Takhisis
There were originally six Demon’s Maw javelins in existence, crafted by a dark prince of the lower hells. This demon passed them on to his generals to capture his enemies, that he might “interrogate” them at his leisure at a later date. The prince was destroyed when his generals turned on him, and the battles between them caused such devastation on their plane that it is still uninhabitable today. The survivors scattered to other planes and some of the javelins have found their way into other hands…including one held with mixed emotions on the Material Plane by an order of paladins dedicated to slaying demons.

Each Demon’s Maw is a +2 javelin. The weapon has the appearance of smooth carbon, although it is

specially treated steel, and the grip is made from what appears to be a rat’s tail entwined about the shaft. The head is carved with many leering, demonic mouths on both sides, which sometimes move about and silently articulate profane words in the Abyssal tongue. Once per day the wielder may invoke a binding spell (minimus containment form) upon a creature stuck by the weapon. The creature may attempt a Will saving throw (DC 18) to resist the effect; failure means the visage of a gaping maw appears to unfold from the point of the javelin, biting and swallowing the rapidly shrinking target. The wielder may release a bound captive with a command word.

Some of the javelins have been imbued with other properties since the generals scattered to the planes. For example, one was crafted with the flaming burst property and is now called Hellmouth, while another was instilled with the unholy ability and is known as Celestial Slayer.

Talons of Tiamat

The Talons of Tiamat are five unique composite bows that were made from the parts of dragons. Despite their apparently malevolant origins, these bows are not inherently evil. In fact, most evil dragons are enraged to learn that parts of their anatomy were used to make these weapons. Each bow is made of a combination of bone, scale and wing membrane taken from an ancient dragon. They are all considered to be +2 bows. The bows were made long ago and only recently rediscovered by The Cult of the Dragon. The entire collection of bows was given the name, Talons of Tiamat, in reference to the cults diety. Each individual bow is named after the dragon from which it was originally taken. Shortly after their discovery, the bows were lost during transportation across the Anauroch desert. They have only recently reemerged again; this time distributed all over Faerun.

Cynder - Cynder is the only bow still in the possesion of The Cult of the Dragon. It is a composite longbow made from a red dragon. It is made from the great reds monstrous fangs and is wrapped in the sinewy skin of its wings. It was designed for an extremely strong man and can only be drawn by a person with 18/00 strength. It is completely immune to fire and grants a +4 to saves to anyone holding the bow. In addition, the bow can generate a bolt of fire 3 times per day that inflicts 3d4 damage.

Frost - Frost is a composite shortbow made from a white dragon. It is one of the more ornately carved of all of the bows and has a glistening, almost irredescent appearance from the scales which cover its surface. It is also designed to advantage of exceptionally strong archers. Anyone attempting to wield Frost must have a strength of 18/51 or greater. Any one wielding Frost gains a +6 to save versus all cold based attacks. In addition, once per day, Frost can shoot an arrow of immense cold that inflicts 3d8 points of damage and will instantly freeze all water in a 30' radius.

Bloodbane - Bloodbane is a composite longbow made from the remains of an ancient green dragon. Of the two longbows, this is the more ornate; its green tones are highlighted with inlaid gold. The bow grants a +2 to saves vs. all noxious fumes. In addition, it grants the user a chameleon-like power that allows him to blend in completely with the environment. This power only functions in natural surroundings and grants a +4 armor class bonus. Like the other bows, this bow can also imbue one arrow per day with a deadly poison that inflicts an additional 2d8 damage (saving throw for half) to the victim.

Skie - Skie is a composite shortbow made from the remains of an ancient blue dragon. It is the most powerful of the shortbows. It is deep blue in color, being wrapped in skin from the dragons wings. The bow grants a +4 to saves vs. all electrical based attacks and the wielder suffers no damage on a successful save. Three times per day, the bow can generate of bolt of lighting that can be shot forth for 3d6 damage. In addition to these powers, all arrows shot from the bow recieve an electrical charge and inflict and additional point of damage.

Khirsanth - Khirsanth is a composite shortbow made from the remains of an ancient black dragon. It has a lustrous black sheen and is almost as striking as Frost. Like Frost, anyone attempting to use this bow must have a strength of 18/51 or greater. The weapon is completely immune to breakage and grants is user a +2 to saves versus acid attacks. Once per day, the bow can generate a arrow of acid that inflicts 3d6 in the intial round. This damage continues for the next two rounds decreasing by a die each round

"    **Thunderstrike:** This _+1 [triarc](http://www.seankreynolds.com/rpgfiles/magicitems/triarcweaponproperty.html)_ (cold, electricity, fire) _shortspear_ was created long ago in the Gulf of Storms in Amn (a valley full of iron deposits and crystals that attract natural electrical strikes and causes all electricity effects to rebound multiple times within it). The haft is made from shadowtop wood, the head from old steel, with four uneven spikes extending from the joint acting as crossguards. The three lightning-bolt symbols of Talos glow dully on the blade, as if with latent heat. If picked up by any creature (whether actually carried in hand or held or transported some other way, its triarc ability activates automatically, causing electrical sparks, minor bursts of flame, and small pieces of ice to form in the air around the blade and mostly obscuring its symbol.  

    The spear was created in 1358 DR (the Year of Shadows, when the Time of Troubles occurred) by Reaver Maegral Bloodtusk (Reaver is a Talosian church title indicating an ordained priest with some experience, not quite a high priest), a half-orc warrior-priest of Talos, who received a rare vision from Talos, telling him to fell a shadowtop with a silver axe, cut its heart into a spear, attach an ancient spearhead to the end, and bring the weapon to the Gulf of Storms. Maegral did so, and after four days of prayer (during which he was struck several times by electricity), a strange storm blew in, created by wizardry and fueled by wild magic. Three bolts from this storm struck the spear at once--red, gold, and blue-white, and when the weapon cooled so that Maegral could touch it, he found the spear had been infused with Talos' power. Naming it Thunderstrike, he used it gather a horde of bandits and orc raiders and used it to terrorize towns and villages in Amn and Tethyr for several years (the burnt-out shells of several towns are testament to his willingness to destroy all in the name of Talos).  
    It is believed that Maegral eventually went mad, perhaps from exposure to too much wild magic (he spent much of his non-raiding time searching for wild magic areas so he could visit them with the spear, in the hopes of increasing its power), for in 1367 DR he ran off screaming in the middle of a raid, leaving Thunderstrike behind. One of the raiders picked it up and it has passed from one hand to another in southwester Faerûn since then. Maegral may still be alive, slowly transforming into something else due to wild magic exposure, for a person matching his description has been spotted in the Gulf of Storms as recently as 11 Marpenoth, 1372 DR, though his hair was fire and his eyes just empty sockets glowing with electricity.  

    The triarc ability of Thunderstrike is particularly bright and lights its vicinity as if it were a torch; as the ability activates whenever the spear is touched, the only way to put out the light is to drop the weapon. Though it normally is a shortspear, as a standard action its bearer can transform it into a longspear or halfspear; if left untouched for more than 24 hours it reverts to shortspear form. It gives cold, electricity, and fire resistance 5 to its wielder when held in hand.

"    **Purity of the Inferno:** This _+2 keen flaming burst rapier_ is made of bright steel, with images of flames constantly moving across its service. The hilt is textured red steel with an oval weight at the base. The basket consists of several flame-shaped arcs of dull yellow or orange metal. A pair of flame-shaped arcs of metal affix the basket to the top of the hilt.  
    The bearer of the rapier is protected by _endure cold_ at all times, whether the weapon is held or just carried. When the _flaming burst_ property activates the entire weapon becomes uncomfortably hot (but not enough to actually cause damage) for several rounds. It is thought that the weapon also bears a lingering spell similar to _refuge_, in which if the proper command word is spoken it will transport the bearer to a safe place. While the command word is unknown, it is almost certain that the spell expires after being used, and the "safe place" is the church of Kossuth in Eltabbar.  
    The rapier was crafted in 972 DR by Red Wizard Dakas Traan for his chief Thayan Knight bodyguard, Vhuras Ghant. Originally a +1 rapier, Dakas Traan added the _flaming_ and _keen_ properties to it over time. When Dakas Traan was slain by a rival, Vhuras joined the church of Kossuth in Eltabbar as a temple guardian. Over the next few years the church rewarded his service by adding the _flaming burst_ property to the weapon and increasing the enhancement bonus to +2. When Vhuras died in his elder years, the weapon given its _endure cold_ ability and was lent to various assassins of the church for use against the churches of Istishia and Auril. On one of these missions in 1073 DR, the weapon was lost in a battle with the powerful ice demon Gurturak of the Nine Faces. Several forays into the demon's Abyssal lair by the church over the next two hundred years failed to recover the weapon, but an independant group of adventurers managed to slay the demon in 1302 DR and loot his lair, including the rapier. When the Eltabbaran church heard of the weapon's return they offered a reward to the adventurers for its return. When the adventurers refused, the church had them assassinated and reclaimed the rapier. In 1360 DR the church sent an assassin to kill the Istishian high priest in Procampur, but the attack was accidentally thwarted by a group of adventures on an assignment from the Harpers. The rapier was last seen in 1361 DR in the hands of Brond Fendril, an adventuring rogue intent on exploring Castle Grimshadow in western Shadowdale.  
    _Caster Level:_ 12th, _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _endure cold_, _flame blade_/_flame strike_/_fireball_; _Market Price:_ 54,520 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 27,420 gp + 2,168 XP."

"    **Voice of Dawn:** This _+2 disruption heavy mace_ was originally wielded by a young Harper named Loryn in 916 DR. Present at the final battle between Lathander's avatar and Sammaster (the founder of the Cult of the Dragon), the young man's heart broke at the sight of the avatar's wounding by one of the lich's disrupted spells. After the battle, Lathander's avatar ressurected the young man and, recognizing the intensity of his faith, blessed his otherwise unremarkable weapon with several magical powers. Loryn became a paladin of Lathander and quested to slay dracoliches, succeeding at least three times.  
    In addition to its primary abilities, the haft end of the weapon can create a spear blade of light, equivalent to a _+1 brilliant energy halfspear_. The weapon is not quite long enough to be able to be used as a double weapon, so the wielder must decide which end to use for any particular round. The weapon is self-identfying and glows with light at all times, even when not held.  
    The weapon is made of quality steel, and the haft is wrapped in tan-colored leather. The weapon is a legendary item in the church of the Morninglord, although it is not an artifact. The weapon was last seen in Chessenta 5 years ago, carried by a woman who went completely hooded at all times. She is suspected to have been an agent of the Cult of the Dragon, but she is protected against divination.  
    _Caster Level:_ 16th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _continual flame, gaseous form, heal_; Market Price: 82,613; Cost to Create: 41,613 gp + 3,280 xp."

## Wailer of Tharizdun
An ornate iron horn.

A strange iron horn with a handle set on either side of its tube. It's horrible, deep tone seems to make the entire world shake around the blower.

Can be used to activate magic seen in the Forgotten Temple of [Tharizdun](https://kingsway-role-playing-group.fandom.com/wiki/Tharizdun "Tharizdun"). It has no other discernible use.

## Weeping Hexagram
An artifact of Tharizdun

Weeping Hexagram; This strange device was found by the Scarlet Brotherhood in 6091 SD, in a cavern near the Ziggurat of Black. It was a ten-foot-diameter ring of black iron inset with a bowed hexagram; it seeped blood when exposed to sunlight. Believed to be tied in some way to the mysterious god, Tharizdun, the Brotherhood began exploring and cataloging its magical abilities, which included the ability to create darkness (deeper darkness), animate dead, attack minds with phantoms (phantasmal killer), and summon creatures from other planes (summon monster I-IX- user must be level equal to necessary sorcerer to cast; summon monster IX=18th-level). It was broken in 6096 SD when a party of outworlders led a paladin of Heironeous infiltrated Hesuel Ilshar and discovered the location of the hexagram. The paladin's holy sword broke the hexagram (and was destroyed itself) into three pieces when the two made contact, but the Brotherhood was able to intervene before the artifact was completely destroyed. Now they study the pieces and their fragmented powers, and seek a way to repair the item.     Caster Level: 18th (artifact); Weight: 5lb.; Reference: The Scarlet Brotherhood.
