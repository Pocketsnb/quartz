## Technological Achievements
#### Equipment Modifications
##### Cold Iron
Iron forged in a low heat, fashioned to keep it from being overly brittle. Effective as a weapon against fey.

Cost Modifier: +50gp

##### Crystal-Laced Armor
An ancient and mysterious process, produced by people known as crystal weavers that imbues anything normally made of metal with a special crystal which proves much more resistant to blows. Armor treated with this process reduces bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage taken from non magical weapons by 3. Crystal-laced armor costs 5,000 gp more than a traditional harness of armor. Any armor made of metal can be can be crystal laced, although very few people know the secrets of the process.

Cost Modifier: +5,000gp

##### Exceptional Weapons
Weapons forged with a folding pattern and an edge that keeps its sharpness for a longer period of time, while still being flexible. Weapons created in this manner have a +1 to attack.

Cost Modifier: +200gp

##### Marlite
Marlite shines like blue-tinted iron and can be processed into a metal as hard and resilient as steel. Marlite is valued for its secondary property: Marlite is a magic-dead material. It has no natural magic within it, and it cannot be affected by spells, magic items, or spell-like abilities. A sword made of marlite couldn’t be affected by a heat metal spell, nor could it be magically disintegrated, and it cannot be moved through magical means.

This means, of course, that magic can’t affect it in beneficial ways, either—it couldn’t receive enchantments or be used in creation of magical foci.

Armor made of marlite gives the wearer no special properties. Spells can still affect the wearer, just not the armor directly.

Cost Modifier: x10 the normal price

##### Tyrnas Cloth
Silk treated in a specific manner so that it becomes incredibly strong. Properly applied, the new material is capable of resisting crossbow bolts. Most often used in clothing for officers or nobles.

Light armor made of Tyrnas Cloth reduces slashing and piercing damage from non-magical sources the wearer receives by 2.

Cost Modifier: +200gp

#### Materials
##### Firestone
The mineral known as firestone can be created only through imbuing specific crystals harvested from the underdark with magic. It burns with great efficiency, which causes technologists to desire it greatly to fuel their devices. A small stone weighs 1 lb. and can burn hotly for twenty-four hours. It is used as a source of heat.

##### Liquid Light
Deep in the earth one can encounter pools of bright sunlight, preserved forever as a thick, milky liquid. One pint of this fluid is the equivalent of a daylight spell that never fades.

One can use liquid light to modify some spells. A pint of the material used as a spell component modifies the any damage dealt to radiant.

Liquid light inflicts damage to evil-aligned outsiders and undead if used as a splash weapon (one pint inflicts 2d6 points of radiant damage; full immersion inflicts 20d6 points of radiant damage). It heals good-aligned outsiders in like amounts. Liquid light is worth 500 gp per pint and is usually found only in amounts of six to ten pints at a time. 

#### Objects
##### Glider Wings
A Medium creature can strap on these aerodynamic wings to glide through the air.

A character can train in their use (Tool Proficiency: Glider Wings) to use them even better. On a still or relatively calm day, the glider travels in a straight line for twice as far as it drops, so a character wearing the wings and jumping from a forty-foot-tall tower can travel eighty feet laterally before landing. On a very windy day, a character can travel much farther (almost indefinitely) if they make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, DC 15, every ten minutes. Landing safely requires another Dexterity (Acrobatics) check of DC 12. Failure results in 1d6 points of damage to both the character and the wings, assuming the wearer dropped at least ten feet. Made of light wood and canvas, the wings have a damage threshold of 3 and 10 hit points. Their wingspan measures fifteen feet.

Price 1,400 gp.

##### Hot-Air Balloon
With a powerful furnace beneath it, a large balloon can carry aloft up to 2,000 lbs. A single character can operate the balloon, controlling its altitude and direction. The latter, of course, depends greatly on the wind’s direction and speed. The balloon itself measures about forty feet across and sixty feet high. The basket below is about eight feet in diameter. A hot-air balloon has a damage threshold of 1 and 5 hit points. The basket has a damage threshold of 3 and 30 hit points.

Price (with furnace) 3,500 gp.

##### Steamboat
A steamboat is a keelboat (fifty- to seventy-five-foot-long vessel) that does not require wind or oar to move. A powerful steam engine fuels its massive paddlewheel. While these boats can’t operate in the ocean (too rough of waters), they are sometimes seen out on Zelen Lake.

Price 18,000 gp.

##### Steam Cart, Large
This vehicle resembles a carriage without the axle and harnesses for horses. With it, a person can haul up to 1,500 lbs. of cargo or passengers. Its top speed is only ten miles per hour. A driver operates it just like they would a carriage, but instead of using reins, there are two levers, controlling movement of the left and right side independently, and it likewise requires firestone to use.

Price 8,000 gp

##### Steam Cart, Medium
This wheeled chair has a steam motor and room enough for equipment or a passenger up to 250 lbs. Controlling the cart in motion is a full-round action. It can move five miles per hour but requires firestone.

Price 5,000 gp

##### Steam Cart, Small
This is basically a wheeled chair with a steam motor. Controlling the cart in motion is a full-round action. It can move up to five miles per hour and requires firestone to use.

Price 3,000 gp

##### Syringe
This is an easy way to inject a potion directly into a creature. If the syringe is in hand and full, injecting is only a bonus action.

50 gp 1/2 lb.
