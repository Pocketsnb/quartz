*These spells require an additional expenditure of downtime days (150 for resurrection and 350 for true resurrection). This cost can be reduced by 50 days for each faction rank above ‘1’ that the character possesses. This downtime is spent in community service for the church that provided the spell in question. The Acolyte Background feature does NOT reduce the gp or downtime cost for either of these spells.
