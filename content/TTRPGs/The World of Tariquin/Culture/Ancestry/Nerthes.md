## Nerthes
Evolved from the [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Ancestry/Faen|Faen]], the Nerthes did not wish to regain their power over magic and instead left [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Geography/Tariquin/Saltus/Saltus|Saltus]] to the south west, to live among the [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Ancestry/Tortle|Tortle]] on the continent they named Kar Nerthes. Here, they learned the ways of oracle and worship of Melora.
