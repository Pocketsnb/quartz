## Faen
The ancestor race to the [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Ancestry/Stakkar|Stakkar]] and the [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Ancestry/Nerthes|Nerthes]]. The Faen come from what is now known as The Shadowfell, and had fled their realm that was under attack from an unstoppable force through magical means. Upon leaving their realm, they lost their connection to magic. Those that wished to regain the connection remained on [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Geography/Tariquin/Saltus/Saltus|Saltus]] and became the Stakkar, those that left in self exile lived with the [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Ancestry/Tortle|Tortle]] to become the Nerthes.
