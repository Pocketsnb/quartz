## Osle
A large ox-like creature with a thick musky fur coat that it sheds each spring. This wool has two distinct layers, a long thick haired outer layer, and an extremely soft water resistant under layer. The osle also grows a rack of horns during the late spring months, shedding them during next year’s early spring to grow a new set. The osle is bread for a variety of reasons. It’s fur can be used in the crafting of fabrics often used in clothing; while its horns can be used for crafting of buttons, jewelry, and other forms of ornamentation. The osle’s size also makes them ideal for pulling of wagons or plowing of fields. Those who live in the Kalashet Steppes rely on the osle to supply them with the clothing needed to survive in the winter season.
