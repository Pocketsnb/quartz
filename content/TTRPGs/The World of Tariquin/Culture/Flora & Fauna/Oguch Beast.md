Description

Giant quadrupedal reptiles, the oguch beasts wander the plains in thunderous herds. Oguchs are warm-blooded herbivores. They graze primarily on quick-growing grasses, but eat the leaves of shrubs and trees they encounter as well. Oguchs occasionally eat insects, small mammals and eggs, but these items are a limited part of their diet.

Oguchs are key to minotaur culture. Minotaur hunt and use every part of oguchs for their equipment, clothing and food. Oguchs can be trained and are used as beasts of burden by the minotaur and as mounts. Oguchs are a symbol of vigor and power among the minotaur, and hunting them is an important rite of passage for young warriors. The warriorsâ€™ bravery, strength and ability to work together are tested.

Like many herd animals, oguch beast groups are composed of mothers and young, led by a single powerful male or female. A few younger males may be present, but they are eventually driven out to establish their own herds. During mating season, typically in early spring, oguchs make loud bellowing sounds to guard their territories. Oguch beasts are dangerous at this time, as males are on the watch for rivals and become territorial. Mothers become dangerous later, protecting their nests.

Though terrifyingly large and powerful, oguch beasts are by nature quiet, lumbering animals. They are content simply to wander away from potential threats. One notable exception is when they are protecting eggs or yearlings, which are small enough to be threatened by most predators. Oguch beasts form rings around the young, barring attack with simple mass. Sufficiently annoying opponents are charged and swallowed whole. More significant threats, particularly those too large to swallow, are run down. Spooked oguch herds stampede.

During mating or nesting seasons, oguchs are more aggressive, particularly if startled or surprised. They leave small annoyances alone, though they make mock charges to scare off persistent annoyances.
