Keen Smell. The riding oguch has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

Charge. If the riding oguch moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
Actions

Gore. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8+5) damage.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d8+5) damage. and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the riding oguch can't bite another target.

Swallow. The riding oguch makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the riding oguch, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the riding oguch's turns. The riding oguch can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the riding oguch dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.
Oguch Mounts

A oguch beast is rarely trained as a mount, being too big and feisty to be trained as a typical mount. However, minotaur breed smaller riding oguchs, which lack much of their larger cousinâ€™s strength. Riding oguchs are quicker, however, and easier to train. This training requires a successful Handle Animal check (DC 16 for a young riding oguch, DC 21 for an adult) and that the oguch is willing to be trained. The training takes approximately 1 year.

Theft of oguch eggs is punishable by death, but a poacher can sell riding oguch eggs for upwards of 1,400 gp. Fully-trained riding oguchs are rarely sold, but their market price is about 2,000 gp. A riding oguch has a carrying capacity of 600 pounds.
