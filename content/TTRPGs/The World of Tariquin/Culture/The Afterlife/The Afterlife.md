## The Afterlife
The Fugue Plane is a neutral plane within the Astral Sea where the souls of mortals are drawn when they die. The vast majority of this plane is flat, gray, bland and nondescript, with no notable topographical features, the sky overhead is also gray. The plane's only significant feature is the City of Judgment in the middle of which stands the Crystal Spire where The Endless Path and Jergal reside and it serves as the former's dominion. There are only three methods of getting to the Fugue Plane: as a divine servant collecting a deity's future petitioners, through non-permanent portals from the Nine Hells or the Abyss, or through death.
