## Session 51
The party traverses the Labyrinth, its walls veined throughout with the faezress. After a day, they come across a large adamantium tower at edge or ravine. Inspecting the tower and attempting to enter, gargoyles at the top awaken and fight the party, but they are quickly dispatched. Unable to open the door, Xael see's through a crack and teleports inside. Within, he comes across the sole occupant, dead, and a potion he quickly drinks. Traveling to the second floor, he is attacked by shadow demons. Fleeing with his life, he returns to the party, able to read the surface thoughts of his companions for a period of time. The party travel around the tower and descend the ravine.

On their third day of travel within the labyrinth, they come across a frog-like demon, a Hezrou, tearing at some mining tracks in a small tunnel. Alerted, the demon attacks, but they kill it before it can cause too much harm. The party then reach a bridge over a rift, where sit some shrieker mushrooms. Silencing them, they cross the bridge without issue. On their fourth day, they reach the entrance to a maze.
