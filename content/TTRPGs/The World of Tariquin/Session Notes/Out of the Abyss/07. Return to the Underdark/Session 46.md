## Session 46
The party sneaks through a side passage, freeing some dwarves and drow from a pit. The drow flee, but the dwarves remain behind, informing them that the war marshal of the troglodytes lead an attack against a drow scouting party, recovering a magic sword. The chief, on the other side of the water, laid claim to the sword, but the war master and his followers disagree. Continuing along the side passage, they encounter some more troglodytes and some ropers before deciding to take a rest.
