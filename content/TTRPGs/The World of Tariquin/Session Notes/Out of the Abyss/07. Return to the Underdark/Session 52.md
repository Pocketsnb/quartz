## Session 52
The party traverses the maze, called the Spiral of the Horned King, with the help of a gnoll named Gnash. Reaching the other side, the Gnash tells them of the Filthriddens. The party heads there, finding they worship Yenogu. The party slays them and continues south. After a few encounters, the party reaches a crack in the wall, through it they hear marching. Travelling down the crack, they find a group of unusually shaped creatures.
