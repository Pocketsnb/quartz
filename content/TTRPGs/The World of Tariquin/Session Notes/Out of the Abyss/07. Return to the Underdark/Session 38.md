## Session 38
Intending to find Mouse and Osle to assist in their travels to the lost Khundrukar, the party teleports to Rubicon, where the party splits up. Xael runs into Hari, who recently relocated and is working at Whitfeather's Fineries and has rented out Mouse for cart pulling. As Tazlynn and Andr'el are awaiting near the last building in the town, Tazlynn notices Mouse head by pulling a cart. Following the cart, the party meets up at Whitfeather's. The party takes their leave and heads back to Stracili along the roads.

Reaching Stracili, Xael hooks up his luxurious cart to Mouse and the party begins to head back to Rubicon, planning on heading north, before Andr'el receives a message from Proclin informing him of their summons by King Montgomery to Daramir at their earliest convenience.

Upon reaching Daramir, the party is escorted in a coach to guest quarters within the castle where they are given the night to rest. In the morning, the party meets with King Montgomery, who questions them about what they had encountered in the Underdark and asks them to convince some important figures to assist in clearing the underdark of the demon lords, with the party leading the charge.

Before the dinner, Uraelle enjoys some time in a park in the northern section of the city, while Xael visits a graveyard, plotting use of the whistle to raise the dead.
