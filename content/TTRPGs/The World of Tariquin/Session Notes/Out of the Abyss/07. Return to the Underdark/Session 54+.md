## Session 54+
Ambushed by grell and minotaurs, the party quickly dispaches them and continues forward.
After travelling a few more days, the party reaches the Gallery of angels and learns of what's occurring within the underdark, and recover the last ingredient, angels feathers.
Next, they assist the modrons to the Orderer, but once there, find it being put to use by demons. The demons, wishing to use the Orderer to their own ends, attempt to activate the device.
As the Orderer begins to fall into lava, the party successfully sends the modrons back to their home plane and defends it from the demons. But right before it falls into the crevasse of lava, it activates one last time and sends the party back to when they awoke in Velkynvelve.
