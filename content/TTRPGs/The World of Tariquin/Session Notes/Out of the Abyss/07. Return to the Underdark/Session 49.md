## Session 49
The party reaches the outskirts of the beholders lair and find a side cavern a few miles off to camp in. Xael takes the opportunity to sneak forward, always feeling watched by eyes he can see just on the distance of his vision. As he enters a large tube spanned with bridges, he finds that the inhabitants worship the beholder, Karazikar, as a god. Convincing them to gather for worship. The procession leads him to a central chasm, where he soon finds there's even a high priest that disperses the gathering.

Returning to the party, Xael tells them of what he saw, and they decide to kill the high priest in hopes of infuriating the beholder to leave its lair
