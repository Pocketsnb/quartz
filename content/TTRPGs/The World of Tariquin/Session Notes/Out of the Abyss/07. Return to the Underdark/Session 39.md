## Session 39
The party attends the dinner service, convincing the various faction representatives in attendance to supply troops to the expedition to the Underdark, and especially convincing the Knight's Shadow to assist in reaching Gravenhollow, the underground library containing a variety of ancient tomes about the demon lords. In return for the troops, some of the representatives ask for some assistance. The Zelen Lake Alliance has an operative spying on the drow under disguise as one, but has lost contact with her; while the Wardens of Twilight have lost a scout somewhere in the Underdark. Davra Jassur readily supplies the party with some Knight's Shadow thugs to lead them to Mantol-Derith in order to find their operative, Ghazrim DuLoc, who can lead them to the Underdark library.

It's also revealed that Proclin is a member of the Order of the Silver Star. He challenges Andr'el to a chess match for access to a shield guardian. Andr'el loses the chess match, but Xael steals the control amulet (with Proclin's blessing) giving it to Andr'el in the night.

The following day, the party heads to Crane's Magical Devices, purchasing a variety magical items to assist them in the Underdark. Heading out, they reach some hills to the south west of the city, entering a cave guarded by Knight's Shadow members. Once in the Underdark, they navigate their way to Mantol-Derith, defeating oozes and assisting escaped slaves in reaching the surface. Reaching the outpost through a secret door in a trench, they hear sounds of combat of to the south.
