## Session 53
Xael contacts the creatures and begins communication, it seems they want to leave. Once a form of useful communication is found, they agree to aid the party in reaching the Orderer by first guiding them to the Gallery of Angels. Departing and once again heading to the Orderer, they come across Yenogu defeating a goristro. The party watches as Yenogu leaves, they defeat the remaining gnolls and acquire a goristro heart and some demon lord blood, some of the last ingredients they require. Continuing to the Gallery of Angels, they are ambushed.
