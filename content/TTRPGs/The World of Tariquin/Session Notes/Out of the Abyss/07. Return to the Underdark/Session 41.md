## Session 41
Taking a moment to speak with Ghazrim, the party reveals they are in the Underdark seeking to rid it of the demon lords and require information from Gravenhollow. Ghazrim outfits the party and their troop with supplies and gives them a ring that will guide them to their destination.

While Andr'el oversee's the resupply, the rest of the party heads in the direction of the fleeing drow, towards their enclave. In the surrounding mushroom area, they meet two people: Zilchyn Q'Leptin, a drow cartographer whom they commission a map of the Wurm Writhings; and Flink, a svirneblin who tells the party about what's happening in Mantol-Derith.

According to Flink, the dreugar came across a large gem and had sold it to Flink mistress. Flink was then given the gem, and told to trade it to the drow for components to an invisibility spell. The dreugar claimed the gem was stolen and started killing all the svirneblin. During the chaos, Flink got away, but the gem was stolen by one of the stone gargoyles under the employ of the drow.

Continuing to follow the path left by the fleeing drow, Xael approaches the entrance to the drow warehouse with his fellow party members where they are stopped. Thinking quickly, he changes his appearance to that of one of the female guards that had died, claiming to have been in disguise to escape safely. Being granted access to the warehouse, he confronts Kinyel Druu'gir, learning that the gem had been given to her by a gargoyle, and that it is a secret order from Menzoberrenzan to slay the beholder. Taking the dark gem, Xael sees within it a brush of some decaying tentacle against its inside surface and falls to madness, never capable of revealing his true intentions to anyone.

Leaving the warehouse, he joins back with the party and they leave Mantol-Derith towards Gravenhollow. During the first few days of travel, Uraelle has a short fit of laughing; some supplies are found to have been poisoned, but not before both Knight's Shadow and Zelen Lake Alliance members contract sewer plague; some dead fire beetles are found; the party avoids an ochre jelly; and they encounter Juiblex.

During combat with Juiblex, Uraelle looses contact with her patron, losing all magical abilities. The party, realizing the strength of their foe, flee, sending back a goat with Focuses Curse tied around its neck.
