## Session 47
Soon after starting their rest, the party hears a commotion in the main chamber. Investigating, Xael sees that the troglodytes are attacking each other. Deciding to interfere, he fires a few bolts before being discovered and making an escape and hiding in a crack in the ceiling. After the party finishes their rest, they head to the main chamber to discover the troglodytes on alert and searching for the lone drow. The party engage the troglodytes and the troglodytes, never backing down from a fight, accept the challenge before being annihilated.

The party recovers the magic sword and continue towards the worm nest.
