## Session 50
As the party approaches the entrance, they begin to have second thoughts. Xael disguises himself once again and leads a follower out to question him. The party does not know what to ask, so Xael knocks him out.

Discussing their course of action, the party decides to leave the beholder for later, and head back to their camp to teleport back to Araj. Xael remains behind, and within a globe of silence, sacrifices the follower to his patron, The Imprisoned One. Finding that Xael is missing, the party sends back some scouts to find him. Being discovered, Xael tells them he'll catch up, and the scouts return, warning the party to leave Xael behind as he was torturing the follower, something they despised.

Completed with his sacrifice and message he leaves the beholder, Xael returns and the party teleports back to Araj. Reaching Araj, they rest before deciding their next destination as the Labyrinth. Before heading out, the Knights of the Wardens of Twilight have a discussion without Xael around, informing them they will not travel with Xael. Uraelle speaks with Vizeran, who produces an amulet that suppresses the demon lords madness, supposedly what has caused Xael to act as he does. Another amulet, on Xael's behest, is given to Andr'el. Mollified, the knights agree to travel and head out with the party to the Labyrinth.
