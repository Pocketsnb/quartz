## Session 44
Reaching the singer, the party discovers it to be a basilisk, who speaks to the party in a curt manner, informing them he is there to guide them to the library. At the library, the party explores the various levels and rooms, eventually coming across one of the librarians who shows the party how to use one of the crystals to access more information. Uraelle finds that demon lords appeared by Gromph, within the city of Menzoberranzan, was tricked by to summon the demon lords, The Tangled Web is still in the abyss, and that there are a variety of demon lords throughout the underdark, including one within a gem being carried by the party. With Xael's assistance, she learns of an ancient sword within the horde of a black dragon.

Xael comes across a map room, copying down various charts, finds a few books describing vaguely how The Imprisoned One was imprisoned within the bottom of the abyss by the two gods The Wild and The Bestial, and the various attempts taken in the future to restore The Imprisoned One to power.

Andr'el finds books describing a few dragons and dragonborn that have traveled through the underdark, and stumbled across Vizeran, whom Andr'el assisted in discovering how Gromph was involved in the events that took place in the demon lords appearing in the underdark.

Tazlynn found a few books on the stonework of the library and its enchantments that keep the library from being discovered, about Khundrukar (Glitterheim) history, and of events happening in Graklstugh.

Afterwards, the party was approached by Vizeran, who offered them information if they would follow him to his tower.
