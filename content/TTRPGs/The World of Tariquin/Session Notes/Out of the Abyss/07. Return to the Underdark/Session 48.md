## Session 48
As the party travels down the passages, they hear a voice warning them to turn back. Ignoring the warning they continue and come across a drow, Hanne Hallen, on a ledge out of reach. Befriending her, they learn she was out hunting for purple worm eggs before being separated from her mother and their hunting party, the Dark Hunters. They then convince her to go come along.

The next day, the party falls into a hole. Exploring the new chambers they find themselves in, they find some loose earth to the east with bones scattered all about, while Andr'el and Uraelle find a deep pit to the south. It seems a former adventurer had fallen into the deep pit and became stuck on a ledge. Andr'el nearly suffers the same fate as he falls in too, but climbs out.

As the earth begins to shake, the party takes shelter as a purple worm bursts through the walls, excavating an entrance to the worms nursery. The party harvests some eggs, being careful not to alert the worms of their intrusion. While doing so, the Dark Hunters appear and Hanne is reunited with her mother. The party then heads out, on their way to a beholders lair.
