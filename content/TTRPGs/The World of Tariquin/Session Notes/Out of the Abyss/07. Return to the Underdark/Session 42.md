## Session 42
Continuing their travels to Gravenhollow, the party is alerted of a pair of chasmes demons ahead that they choose to avoid. A few days later, those caring for the giant lizards have an argument on how to treat an issue with mites one has contracted. The argument gets the attention of a rocktopus that the party quickly slays.

As the party continues to travel, Uraelle feels a breeze of cold coming from a small fissure in the cavern wall, secretly investigating it, she finds herself emerging in a snow white blizzard. The blizzard freezes in place, and her patron, the Snow Queen appears. Working out a deal, Uraelles powers are restored, with the ultimatum that if she does not do as she's told once done in the Underdark, there will be dire consequences. Returning to the troop, only moments have passed as she joins back up.

During the following days, a knife is reported stolen, two members of the Knight's Shadow and a member of the Zelen Lake Alliance disappear with no traces, and two members of the Wardens of Twilight contract sewer plague.

The troop then encounters three goblin scouts. Chasing them through tunnels for a few hours, they reach a small camp of goblins. Andr'el quickly dispatches of them with a fireball and the party captures and questions two of them. The goblins report being a part of a lost collection from their tribe after fleeing a group of demons, and don't know where the rest of their tribe and their leader, Boss Nass, are located. Under threat and fear, they tentatively join the troop.

A few days later, a brawl between the Knight's Shadow and the Wardens of Twilight occurs, which reveals some other issues the troop currently has, including fear of the party leaders, of their lives, and generally hoping to have a greater say in how things go. The group takes a few days to build teamwork and cooperation to aid in ridding the Underdark of the demon lords.

When travel begins again, they reach a small group of vrock, where the party and the troop test out their new cooperation, making quick work of the demons.
