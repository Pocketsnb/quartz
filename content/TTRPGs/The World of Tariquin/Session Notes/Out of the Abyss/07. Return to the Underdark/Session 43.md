## Session 43
Two days after, the parties scouts report the presence of a small group of goblins ahead. Sending one of the goblins and Xael ahead, the find that it's the troupe the goblins had been separated by, currently eating and roasting fish. As time passes, the rest of the party approaches, and combat ensues, with only one of the new goblins remaining alive.

As the party continues their travels, they come across a group of dead kuo-toa, presumably killed in battle by the goblins. Nearly six days later, the party faces off against a fly-like demon that causes the party to fall unconscious with its lulling rhythm, but manage to break free and slay the creature, recovering its proboscis. Fifteen days later, the party hears what sounds like singing in a variety of languages.
