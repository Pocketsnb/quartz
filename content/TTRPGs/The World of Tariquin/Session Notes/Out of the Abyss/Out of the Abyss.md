## Out of the Abyss
Centuries have passed, and in our current time, vampires are appearing near the edges of civilization, Drow are embarking on riskier ventures to the surface, and the Shadowfell is growing in power and encroaching into the Material Plane.

The King of [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Geography/Tariquin/Saltus/Realms/The Diamond Throne/The Diamond Throne|the Diamond Throne]] has ordered reinforcement of current keeps and castles, construction of new keeps, and reconstruction of older ancient locations in anticipation of an upcoming assault by [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Geography/Tariquin/Saltus/Realms/The Imperium of Life/The Imperium of Life|the Imperium of Life]]. 

### Party Summary
#### Andr’el Merstasia
Born by the product of a raid by a band of white dragonborn, Andr’el Merstasia has never knew comfort or family while growing up. After being left on the steps of an orphanage, he grew up on the streets a half-breed, fending for himself and not knowing his heritage until the great Sorcerer Proclin found him. Seeing that Andr’el was gifted in the ways of magic, Proclin raised him, instilling a sense of order into Andr’el’s life. Andr’el seeks his past, looking for hints of his heritage among elven tribes.

#### Uraelle Mura’kai
Uraelle Mura’kai grew up a member of a merchant house, quickly picking up on the ins and outs of bargaining and trade at a young age. While growing up comfortable, Uraelle spent her time scamming others her age out of various items, trinkets, and favors. She has since graduated to proper cons, lies, and intimidation to acquire goods and rarities, even occasionally dipping into black market trading. Due to a… disagreement of terms with a client, Uraelle has taken to traveling in caravans and ships for new and rare items under the guise of research for the Alliance of the Golden Dawn, leaving the shop to her brother, Aymery.

#### Tazlynn Fandral
Tazlynn Fandral was born into a honorable dwarven family, until her great grandfather Torbin Fandral disgraced the clan. Now the last of her clan, Tazlynn seeks to return honor to her family. A member of the Wardens of Twilight, she hunts the darker things on the periphery of civilization using the training she received when young.

#### Xael
Xael was born in the drow city of Maerimydra. His family, while not the most honored among The Tangled Webs children, was strong, until a failed raid of a grander house planned by his grandmother. During the raid, Xael came across an ancient scabbard of an unknown ancient kingdom. Upon touching the scabbard, Xael’s mind was taken to another place, where a great old one granted him powers beyond expectation. Exiled to the surface on penalty of death, Xael’s family now humbly tends an osle farm in the Kalashet steppes, while Xael, seeking a way of controlling this power, has set off on his own. Upon meeting the sorcerer Proclin, Xael gained a wealth of knowledge surrounding his new powers and now works for Proclin, “procuring” for him a variety of treasures, often associated with doom, the great old one, and its ancient kingdom.

#### Aiyu Nordingham III
Aiyu Nordingham III had magic, but they didn’t have everybody else’s stuff. That would have to be fixed.

#### Oscura
Oscura, a Kenku sailor with a penchant for curses, finds herself inland during the winter months attempting to find warmer climes. When she sees a group of adventurers carrying some bodies back to the Baroness of Redwater's mansion, she decides to follow, being hired on to NAGA.
