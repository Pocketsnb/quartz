## Session 11
After a few days of travel, the dancing stops and the party reaches the surface with winter in full swing. Xael recognizes their location and heads north west towards the Diamond Throne, with plans to have Eldeth reach Daramir to warn the king. After a few days of travel, a blizzard is fast approaching. The party takes residence in the storm shelter of a ruined house, Uraelle wandering off to discover a nest of ghouls. The party summarily defeats them before awaiting the end of the storm and digging themselves out. Traveling further north west, they reach the outer gates of Eastguard, within the Barony of Easthold.
