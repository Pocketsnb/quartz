## Session 06
The party travels through the underdark following their guide, Sarith, as he leads them through the maze of tunnels, chimneys, and tight squeezes. Xael quickly loses his food and water supplies, but with no pressure to be hasty, Tazlynn and Eldeth are able to gather supplies as they travel. The walls for the first five days glow with a slowly pulsing red hue.

After four days, they reach a small cavern filled with a variety of mushrooms; fire lichen, barrelstalk, torchstalk, and nightlight. With barrelstalk and fire lichen available, the party gathers many days worth of food and water. As they camp for the night, they are attacked by a band of goblin slaves, though they make quick work of them.

The next day, they run across some ruins underground. Xael decides to taste the ruins, finding them slightly wet from his saliva. Uraelle searches through the ruins, coming across a few unusual artifacts; A bronze pentacle, a silver badge, a book telling tale of a fallen hero, and a sketch of a mechanical device. After searching the ruins, for a few minutes after, Uraelle can’t help but be impressionable. As the party passes through the ruins, Uraelle gains an odd fixation to the bronze pentacle, believing it to be a lucky charm, that passes in a few hours.

Two days afterward, they encounter a voice speaking within their minds. It warns them of the faerzress, the glowing red walls, and its effects from being exposed for too long, as well as the presence of demons within the underdark, before leaving with a final mention to contact the Society of Brilliance if they require assistance.

As they get closer to their first destination of Sloobludop, the party spots a pack of escaped goblin slaves and attack before they see the party, making short work of them. A day later, they are assaulted by a band of kuo-toa that attack without prejudice. After the fight is finished, Xael cooks up a kuo-toa while they rest, and another band approaches, though this one is lead by Ploopploopeen, Archpriest of Bilbdoolpoolp the Sea Mother, who tells the party of the problems at Sloobludop, asking for help.

Leading them to his abode, he recounts his plan to offer the party as a “sacrifice” before turning on his daughter, Bloppblippodd and overthrowing the new god Leemooggoogoon the Deep Father, and offers to pay them handsomely in coin, pearls, and fish intestines. The party accepts and takes a day to prepare for the event.

Ploopploopeen leads the party to the altar to the Deep Father, and feints interest in joining their worshipers. At the top of the dais, as the party is about to be sacrificed, Ploopploopeen attacks his daughter and a fight breaks out between the kuo-toa. Topsy and Turvy are slain in the coup, and as Bloppblippodd dies, a disturbance can be seen off of the water, as the Demon Lord Demogorgon rises from the Darklake's depths. The kuo-toa stop their fighting, and begin prostrating, chanting in unison the name of their new god.

The party, seeing fit to flee, head to the boats, but Tazlynn is fixated and in awe of the appearance of the Demon Lord, and cannot move on her own. Uraelle returns for Tazlynn and carries her to the boats, where they row away, watching Demogorgon laying waste to the city of Sloobludop. The kuo-toa guides within the boats eventually snap to their senses, and helps guide the party across the Darklake towards Neverlight Grove.
