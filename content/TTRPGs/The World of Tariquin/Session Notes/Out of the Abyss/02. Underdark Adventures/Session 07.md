## Session 07
After escaping Demogorgon, the party travels across the Darklake in two boats. On their first day of travel, they encounter an aquatic troll swimming among some submerged stalagmites. One of the boats runs upon the rocks, but stays afloat, and the troll is quickly dealt with, a leg left as a trophy. A few days later, a traveling kuo-toa is encountered, whom Xael trades the trolls leg for a fish-hook knife carved from a large fish bone.

The party travels along the waters for a few more days before they run into a suddenly low ceiling. While attempting to navigate from the area, they are beset by a group of marrow attempting to flip the boats. The party thwarts their plans, surviving the attack and continue on their way.
