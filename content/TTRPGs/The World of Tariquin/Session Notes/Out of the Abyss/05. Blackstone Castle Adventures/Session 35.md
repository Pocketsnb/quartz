## Session 35
As the party finishes their climb, they are greeted by Meepo, who is guarding the sunken tower. Discussing among themselves, they decide not to visit Lajavara and instead ask Meepo to lead them to Yusdrayl, the kobold chieftain, telling her the area below is clear. Carrying the bodies of the two remaining adventures Sharwyn and Sir Bradford, the party braves the cold weather, heading back to Rubicon.

They Arrive in Rubicon after the sun sets, and only a few buildings into the town, they are confronted by guards asking as to why they are carrying a dead body. Informing the guards that they had been tasked by Kerowyn to assist in exploring Blackstone castle, the guards hesitantly escort the party to Redwater Manor.

Passing the inn, Oscura notices the escort and follows, curious as to what is happening. When the party reaches Redwater Manor and speaks with the Baroness, Kerowyn asks a few questions regarding the other missing adventurers, specifically Talgen Redwater, and whether his signet ring was returned. Andr'el, attempting to play against the baronesses grief, withholds the ring in hopes of a greater reward. Not seeing one forthcoming, he decides not to return signet ring, but Xael steals the ring and returns it.

Watching the events unfold outside the throne room, Oscura convinces guards she is with the adventurers. The party, unsure who this bird creature is, deny at first until Xael see's she has an array of jewlery. When near the party, he attempts to steal a necklace but is observed by Oscura and stopped..

The party is then given a reward for returning the bodies as Mervin is called to court and asked to teleport the bodies to Stracili for eventual transport to Daramir so the bodes can be raised from the dead.

Party rests at inn, the party finds out that Oscura wishes to join the party, hoping they'll head to warmer climes. In the morning the party heads to a bakery for baked goods, Xael insisting a stuffed muffin is a calzone, and into to Mervinâ€™s Magical Muftis for teleportation to Stracili.

Once in Stracili, the party is greeted by Proclin before splitting up.

Uraelle first heads to Local Exotic Goods, finding the shop nearly rebuilt, before meeting with Tazlynn to head to the Golden Dawn Campus and investigate the Gultias tree, finding some information about the Blue Druids and how they relate to the tree.

Oscura and Fenegir wait at the Stony Gaze Tavern, drinking.

Andr'el and Xael head to the orphanage, donating some gold, and a few weapons, before meeting up at the Stony Gaze Tavern, where Tazlynn and Uraelle have headed to after their research.

Uraelle, thinking of looking for an alchemist to identify a few potions, is reminded by Andr'el of the Cobalt Flask where Zaira works. Xael and Oscura work out an agreement of employment before attempting to sell Oscura a dagger she can't afford. Deciding to find an affordable one she heads to Smithy, and speaks with Horken about purchasing a dagger. Showing Oscura an exceptional dagger she can't afford, she instead invites Horken out to drinks that night.

While drinking with Horken, Xael infiltrates Smithy disguised as Horken, but meets Shoomma waiting for her apprentice to return. Sensing his deception is failing, he attempts to stab the old dwarven woman, only to be tossed out on the streets. After finishing drinking, Oscura walks Horken back, who is quite taken by Oscura.
