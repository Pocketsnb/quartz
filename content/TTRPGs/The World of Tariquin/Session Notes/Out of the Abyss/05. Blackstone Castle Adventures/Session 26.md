## Session 26
After resting, Andr'el explores the end of the hallway Uraelle, Tazlynn, and Fenegir went down, while the remaining party members work on opening the door. Andr'el opens a door into a room with a broken cage, and a kobold named Meepo that's hiding. Meepo tells Andr'el that his clans dragon was stolen by the goblins in a separate section of the castle. Andr'el then convinces Meepo to let his party aid in the recovery of the dragon.

At the stone door, the party wedges some crowbars along the edges and force the door open, where a haunting melody can be heard. heading into the room, the party feels a chill down their spine and form goosebumps on their skin. Fenegir, frightened by the sound, refuses to continue onward, opting to watch the door for a returning Andr'el. Xael takes a slightly smokey orb from a pedestal, placing it within his bag of holding, stopping the melody, before continuing through another door into a hallway. Through the hallway, the party steps on pressure plates in the floor and are assaulted by arrows firing from the wall, though no one is injured. Reaching the next room, a statue of a dragon in white marble with red veins throughout stands on one end. Upon approaching the stone dragon, it speaks a riddle

	We come at night without being fetched; we disappear by day without being stolen.

Xael quickly answers "stars" and the wall opposite their entrance slides away revealing another room. Within the room, crumbled statues of humanoid figures in the same marble as the dragon sit in alcoves. In one alcove, Xael discovers a secret door leading to a tunnel. Opposite the way they entered lies spiked pit.

Approaching the pit, an imp appears and pushes Xael into it yelling as it flees that it's watch over the dragon priest is over. Uraelle and Tazlynn make quick work of the imp as Andr'el rejoins the party. Recovering Xael from the pit, the party leaps across, with Fenegir going through the tunnel to reach a room of cracked violet-hued marble tiles with a tomb sealed with rusted clasps and locks, carved with deep imagery of dragons. After resting the party opens the tomb, a mummified dragonborn appear and begins attacking. Defeating the dragon priest, Andr'el leads the party back to Meepo who offers a cooked rat to Xael. Meepo then leads the party to Yusdrayl, the kobold clan leader.

Negotiating with Yusdrayl, the part discovers the Redwaters went off in the direction of the goblins, and haven't been heard back from. Yusdrayl also agrees to reward the party with a selection of goods should they recover the stolen dragon, and sends Meepo along with them.

Taking goblin prisoners for exchange, the party proceeds down a set of hallways to a room with a dry water fountain. Speaking a command word, water begins pouring from it, which the party quickly connects. Opposite the fountain sits a door, touching the handle, a scythe blade nearly slashes Xaels hand off. Andr'el, reading the inscription, inspires Uraelle to splash the door with holy water, causing the door to glow before opening on its own. Within the room stands 5 sarcophagi and an alter. Xael loots the alter, finding a small mythral whistle that when blown, reanimates one of the skeletons. Attempting to goad the skeleton, Xael proceeds to destroy it and the remaining ones in the standing sarcophagi.
