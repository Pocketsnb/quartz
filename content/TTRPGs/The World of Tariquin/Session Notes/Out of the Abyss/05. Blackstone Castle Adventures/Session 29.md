## Session 29
As combat initiates, Uraelle focuses on the hobgoblins while the remaining party guard the door to Goblinville. As spears and arrows are slung at the party, the non-combatant goblins flee. Andr'el, in a side hallway, repels the attack of a hobgoblin before rejoining the party in the smoke filled hallway. Xael attempts to take out the leader, but they seem to have no qualms about throwing other goblins in the way.

Closing the door to Goblinville, Xael braces against the door, Uraelle and Tazlynn finish off the hobgoblins in the side room. As the door is breaks open, a few goblinoids filter through. Fenegir engages in combat as Andr'el launches a devastating line of fire, incinerating most of the goblins, leaving an opening for Xael to approach the leader and finish them.

Exploring the previously hobgoblin occupied room to the side of the smoke filled hallway, the party finds a passage back to the kobolds. Deciding to rest in Goblinville, Xael bars off the doors the non-combatant goblins fled through. While moving piles of rocks to block the door, a door opens to a separate room, revealing the goblin chief, Durnn, and his guards.

Sneaking close and firing off some crossbow bolts, Xael takes out one of the guards, who falls into a large deep pit in the center. Andr'el launches off a fireball, taking out a large number of guards in the room. Uraelle misty steps across the pit, entering melee with the leader. As Tazlynn, Xael, and Andr'el continue to provide cover fire, they take down the Durnn's cleric. Before the party can celebrate, Uraelle falls to the Durnn, and Fenegir heads in to provide assistance. As goblins filter out, Tazlynn and Xael take them out. Soon, Fenegir falls as well. Durnn heads out, and Tazlynn finishes him off.

Taking a long rest, the party recovers treasures, with Xael hiding a Redwater signet ring.
