## Session 27
Continuing onward, the party finds themselves in a room blocked by an iron portcullis. Andr'el melts the metal away, and the party then comes across a hallway filled with caltrops. Xael, ordering the goblins to gather the caltrops after Andr'el blows the majority of them towards the wall, is caught off guard as the goblins make a run for it into the next room, and finds a group of bugbears waiting behind a 3 ft tall brick wall.

As combat ensues, Xael conjures the use of darkness, preventing the bugbears from easily targeting him, as the goblins continue towards the half wall in the dark, and are accidentally slain by the bugbears. Knocking the remaining goblin unconscious, Xael leaps the wall into melee range with the bugbears, while the remaining party remains behind to supply ranged support. Upon defeating the bugbears, the party discovers the goblins have been keeping some kobolds prisoner, as well as a gnome, Erky Timbers, who was asked by Father Fusespark to accompany the Redwaters. However, while running from a nest of giant rats their elven companion, Karakas, was lost and the rest were captured by the goblins. Told the humans were wanted by someone named Belak, Erky was left behind and has been using his divine gift to keep himself alive.

Afterwards, the party enlists Erky to heal them where possible, as the party encounters a room with hobgoblins, making quick work of them.
