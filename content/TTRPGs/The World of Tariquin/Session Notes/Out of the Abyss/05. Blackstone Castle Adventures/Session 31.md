## Session 31
Investigating the south door, the party follows a 10 foot wide passage about 80 feet to a ravine in the earth bisecting the hallway, separating it it by 15 feet and offsetting it by 10. Uraelle uses misty step to cross the ravine and searches out a place to set a piton. Xael tosses across a piton tied to a rope, and Uraelle sets the piton in a hole that once acted as a anchor for a wall sconce, tying the rope off to it. On the north side, Xael hammers a piton into a crack, tying off the rope as well, with Andr'el fixing the knot to ensure it holds.

Xael is the first to walk across, but as he reaches the halfway point, the knot on Uraelle's side slips through the eye of the piton. Xael leaps as he notices, reaching the opposite ledge as Uraelle catches the rope before it falls.

Helping Xael up, they re-affix the rope and the remaining party crosses, with Fenegir remaining behind, giving the excuse to guard the north side of the rope in case anyone should approach.

Continuing around some corners, the party reaches a stuck stone door. With some effort and pry bars, Xael and Tazlynn force the door open, revealing a prayer room to some type of demonic dragon. As the party defaces the crumbling mosaic and topples the statue, Fenegir sends message to Xael about sounds coming from the chamber they just left.

The party re-crosses the ravine and meets up with Fenegir near the door, now closed. Peeking through, Xael spies some miconids, and identifies them as Basidia and their circle. Throwing wide the door, the miconids approach and release their spores, allowing them to speak with the party. Basidia informs them that their circle had arrived a few days ago, but had to clear a cave-in that the furry creatures had caused. Still seeking a place to call home, the party convinces Basidia to remain in the bloody chamber until they clear the remaining lower section of Blackstone castle.

Through the door to the east, the party enters a chamber with six adjoining doors. Through each door, they spy bugbears performing various tasks, from experiments, to repairing armor, to resting. Xael locks the rooms containing bugbears, Uraelle sets out ball bearings and Xael places out caltrops near the doors. Unlocking one of the doors to a room containing barrels, Xael splits them with some thrown hatchets and Andr'el lights the liquid on fire. Quickly locking the door, the bugbears inside burn to death while the remaining bugbears either unlock their doors or break them down.

Overwhelming the bugbears with their tactics, the party disposes of their foes before taking a rest.
