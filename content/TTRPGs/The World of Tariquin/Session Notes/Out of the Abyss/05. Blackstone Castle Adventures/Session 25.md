## Session 25
After arriving at the crevasse leading to Blackstone Castle at night the party awaits for day before heading down the treacherous stairway. In the morning, their guide leaves with the horses back to Rubicon, while the party heads down the switch-back staircase, covered in snow.

Part way down the stairway, NAGA is assaulted by giant rats. Swiftly defeating them, the party continue down into what appears to be the former crenelated battlements of the castle, outside one of it's towers. Heading towards the door, Xael falls into a pit trap with a giant rat and the body of a frozen goblin. Defeating the rat, they head into the interior of the crumbled tower.

On the wall, pinned by a spear is a goblins corpse. Investigating, Andr'el discovers behind the corpse, carved into the wall in draconic, the name "Ashardalon". Unsure who or what Ashardalon is, he puzzles about it as Uraelle opens a door to the left, where more giant rats greet the party.

Within this new room is a locked stone door carved with a dragon and a keyhole set in the mouth. Xael and Andr'el get to work on unlocking the door, while Uraelle, Tazlynn, and Fenegir head down a separate door off the tower. Exploring rooms off the hallway they come across, one appears to contain some form of plumbing system, and upon touching the iron keg within, a water elemental appears and attacks.

Back-tracking to the tower, the trio enlists the help of Xael and Andr'el in defeating the water elemental. Deciding to take a short rest while Andr'el and Xael work on unlocking the stone dragon door, Xael distributes some healing potions to the party, pays Fenegir for his work thus far, and gathers some remains of the water elemental. Near the end of the rest, Andr'el triumphantly unlocks the door.
