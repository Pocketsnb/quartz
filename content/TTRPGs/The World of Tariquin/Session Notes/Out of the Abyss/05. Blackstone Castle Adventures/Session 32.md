## Session 32
Passing through a small room, the characters reach a large hallway covered in soil and all manner of plant life. The vaulted ceilings crumbling, and the walls, covered in mud and vines, displaying a worn fresco of metallic and chromatic dragons at war. Of the few doors in this hallway, the party heads to the northern one, opening into another hallway of equal size and of similar description.

Xael, checking the northern door yet again, opens it to discover a small garden being tended by a bugbear with a scythe. Closing the door, the party comes up with an elaborate plan to frighten the bugbear with an illusory dragon, that Xael is running away from. Putting the plan into motion, Xael enters, carrying a broken orb above his head, Andr'el creating an illusion, and Tazlynn casting a gout of fire from its head.

Frightened, the bugbear ran through a side passageway as the party chased after, Fenegir walking behind. The chase passed a through a room with a statue of a demonic dragon, which startled Andr'el enough to drop the illusion The chase continued through a small closet full of books, into a stairwell room that passed under the garden area, up into a long hallway, and around a corner before Xael finally caught up and stabbed the bugbear, yelling "dragon", but not before a goblin poked his head through a door, seeing the party approaching.
