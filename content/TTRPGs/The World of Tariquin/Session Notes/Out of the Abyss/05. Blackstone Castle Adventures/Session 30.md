## Session 30
Preparing to travel down the large hole in the center of the goblins throne room, Xael inserts some pitons and ties off some ropes, reaching most of the way down. Uraelle, using spider walking boots, attempts to reach the ropes end, slips on the slimy edges of the hole, but catches herself. Hammering additional pitons into some cracks, Uraelle completes the rope-way down.

Upon reaching the bottom of the hole, the party finds themselves in a mostly closed off cavern on a bed of mulch, mildew, decayed bodies of animals, and some vines already entwining themselves around the hobgoblin that fell down the hole. Fenegir is pulled under by something, and while prodding the hole, Xael loses hold of his quarterstaff as a shambling mound appears and releases the unconscious body of Fenegir. As Tazlynn is pulled in by the shambling mound, some twig blights appear, but mostly just annoying the party. Escaping from the shambling mass Tazlynn soon falls in combat with the creature quickly behind. The party uses potions and recovers the health of the fallen comrades before continuing down a square hallway.

Reaching a large, square, blood covered floor of a room, Xael disguised as a twig blight, sneaks up to a wooden board covered in weapons before waking a bugbear, who blows a whistle, calling forth his three dire rat pets. Defeating the bugbear, the party takes a moment to look about the room.
