## Session 28
Continuing down a hallway, Uraelle nearly falls into a pit. Using spider climbing slippers, she opens the door to the other room, trashed with broken furniture, trophies of various creatures and humanoids on the walls, poor taxidermy work, with areas of debris, walls, and floors pockmarked or melted. In a corner, the party discovers the missing dragon, Lajavara, a wyrmling green.

Giving tribute and negotiating with Lajavara, the party works out an agreement. Lajavara will no longer be a pet to the kobolds, will allow the party to live, and occasionally lend treasure to the party if the returns are greater treasure; in turn the kobolds will serve Lajavara, the party will remove the goblinoids from the castle, and seek treasure for the dragons horde.

With a warning to not return until the goblins are exterminated, Lajavara gives the party an ivory tube with dwarven runes. Within, a crumbling message with map, describing where to find the lost caves of Khundrukar.

Continuing through a smokey hall, the party opens two doors at once, revealing Goblinville through one, and a group of hobgoblins through another.
