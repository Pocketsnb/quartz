## Session 34
As twigblights appear from the briers the Gulthias tree pulls it's roots free from the soil and lumbers towards the party. As combat progresses, the tree launches the twigblights at the party, but with a final strike, the tree is split and the bodies of Sharwyn and Sir Bradford, along with those of the twigblights, become dormant. The party then retreats to a safer location to rest before retracing their steps and exploring a few more rooms, defeating various creatures within and ensuring a safer place for Basidia and their circle. Informing the circle of what lies through the various chambers, the party then scales the interior of the sunken tower, returning to the top level of Blackstone Castle.
