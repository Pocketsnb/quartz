## Session 37
In the finale of the Vecna's Hand tournament, Oscura plays against two opponents within a tavern surrounded by guards and an anti-magic field, while the party places bets on who will win. At the end of the tournament, Oscura wins first place.

Heading to the Silver Flagon Inn to participate in the auction, the party bids against three opponents, winning the deed to the building. Andr'el follows one of the bidders, a halfling noble, to the Black Butler Restaurant and Bar, but is prevented from entering. Taking the night to celebrate, the following morning, the party decides to head east to discover more about the Blue Druids.
