## Session 13
Continuing to travel through the night, a secondary party of bandits and cultists appear, taking the party by surprise. Fenegir is quickly struck down, but quick thinking on the part of Xael to create an advantageous landscape, and Andr'el to supply Fenegir with a potion, allow Fenegir to continue fighting. After the battle, a short rest is taken. Continuing to travel northwards as small flurries of snow fall, the party again finds themselves in combat as a contingent of skeletons lead by fanatical cultists assaults them on a hill. What quickly turns into a ranged battle of spells and arrows, the party narrowly succeeds before taking a long rest and recovering from the hard fought victory.
