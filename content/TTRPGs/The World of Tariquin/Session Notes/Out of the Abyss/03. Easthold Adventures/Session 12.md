## Session 12
Once the guards are convinced to let the party in, Eldeth and the party are escorted to the Baron's mansion, while Fenegir, now hired on by Xael, finds rooms for the party at one of the local establishments. Finding themselves before Baron Heskel Sharpe, Eldeth tells of the dire situation within the underdark and requests an contingent of guardsmen to the capitol. Eldeth departs and the party remains, learning a wall is being built around Eastguard to help prevent against marauding dragonborn and that the monastery dedicated to The Final Path within Death's Haven could cure them of their madness.

During the night, Xael, Uraelle, and Andr'el make an excursion to "acquire" supplies for their journey. First gathering a variety of clothes from the tailors, then an odd assortment of goods from the general store.

The next morning, they depart westward, reaching the monastery walls right as the sun goes down, though gaining admittance with ease. Once inside, they are lead to a smaller chapel to discuss the problem at hand. Upon learning the cost to cure the madness is quite expensive, the party agrees to clear the nearby Dead Hills of recent cultist activity, and investigate the possible existence of a wight.

Deciding to travel that night, the party heads out onto the road and immediately encounters a few cultists that surprise the party, though combat is brief with the heroes winning.
