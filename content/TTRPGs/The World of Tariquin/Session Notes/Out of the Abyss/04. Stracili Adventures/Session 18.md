## Session 18
Taking time to form a plan, Andr'el climbs the side of a nearby building, providing cover and attacking snipers as the remainder of the party runs through the roads beneath Xael's darkness. Reaching a burning building, the party makes quick work of thieves standing outside with crossbows drawn, aimed at the building. Appearing from within the building, a guard who gives his name as Conway, and some citizens appear. The party sends them down the road they took, heading through a coopers shop to reach another road.

Continuing to break doors using her massive hammer, Tazlynn leads the way into a bell-founders shop, they send a older halfling and his family to safety, while Xael takes the opportunity to loot the area and steals a sentient bell named Focuses Curse. When rung, the bell produces a distracting laughter.

Passing through a few roads, the party reaches the Silver Flagon tavern and are stopped by a guard. Using thieves cant, Xael identifies the party as members of the guild and gain entry, taking a seat in the back on a long table, far away from the orange and yellow cloaked caster that attacked them two nights before, currently distracted reading over a book. A dwarf appears from the back, serving drinks while Xael plays a game of dice with some thieves guild members. Xael bets focuses curse, ringing it in the process and alerts the caster. Disguised, Xael approaches calmly, speaks momentarily, and then attacks the caster. In response the caster shouts a warning to the tavern goers and uses a dimension door to teleport away.

The party makes swift work of the tavern members before searching the kitchen for secret doors. Finding none, they enter a door heading down a set of stairs to a maze of stone. After a few encounters with pits and poison darts, Tazlynn leads the way through the maze, though stepping aside to let others past, Fenegir falls though a pit, but is swiftly rescued. Soon, the party finds a door to the entrance to the guild proper.
