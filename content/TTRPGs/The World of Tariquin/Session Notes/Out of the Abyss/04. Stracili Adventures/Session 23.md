## Session 23
Standing near the pillar of fire, the party spots a bone devil holding a slate. Discussing how best to proceed, the party decides on using an aura of silence to prevent the devil from calling for reinforcements. During combat, the silence field falls, and Xael puts up an aura of darkness, not realizing devils can see through magical darkness. The party defeats bone devil and investigates the east hall.

Encountering some cultists in the east hall, the party makes quick work of them before investigating the area further. Andr'el comes across a hellhound, attempts to make them a pet, but the hellhound refuses to move from their pile of coats. Investigating the upper level of the east hall, they discover any books describing the hell's are missing, with a trail of footprints through the ash leading to the north hall.

At the north hall, the party searches a few bedrooms, discovering that any alters held within are either damaged or missing. On the second floor, the party finds Therai in their normal tiefling form. After a discussion of where he stands in regards to the parties dealings with the thieves guild, an unusual reunion with Andr'el, and a quick primer on what the books are describing, Therai informs them of how to close the portal to hell.

Spreading a thin line of demon's ash in a circle around the portal and placing candles at each of the four corners, Therai follows a ritual while the party keeps watch for intruders. Once the ritual completes the portal closes and nearby devils are banished back to hell. The party heads back to the inn with Therai to discuss the next steps.

Informing the party that a mind flayer is likely the cause of the earl enlisting the devils, the portal destroying the Temple to the Wardens of Twilight, and the odd dreams and actions of cultists, the party decides to rest for a night before infiltrating the Earls Manor in search of the Mind Flayer. Afterwards, Andr'el offers Therai a position at the orphanage with Therai tentatively agreeing.
