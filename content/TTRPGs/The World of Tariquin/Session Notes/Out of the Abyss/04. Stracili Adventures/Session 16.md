## Session 16
While traveling to Local Exotic Goods, the party is ambushed by the thieves guild, a caster in a bright orange and yellow cloak assisting them. During the battle, Uraelle loses an eye, and after the initial salvo, the party gains their feet and pushes back, forcing the caster to escape. Reaching Local Exotic Goods, the party see's many guards entering and leaving the building. After most of the guards leave, the one watching the front door is put to sleep, and an exploration of the building shows the dead bodies and prisoners missing, along with Aymery.

Returning to the Purple Goat, the party rests for the night, Xael having dreams of being within a great womb. The next morning, the party decides on a plan to search out a healer for Uraelle, then to explore the slums for details on the thieves guild. Reaching the Temple to the Wardens of Twilight, the party is greeted by a priest of Pelor, whom informs the party that restoring the eye would cost 450 gold. Settling on a simple healing spell to remove the damaged eye, the party heads to an apothecary to order a custom prosthetic be made.

Their work in the Temple District complete, the party heads to the slums, tracking down a thief. Upon noticing the party, the thief heads off, the party following, leading them to another thieves guild member who delivers a message. Warned to leave the city within 3 days, Xael decides to leave a message of his own, stabbing him in the kidney. The party chases after the first thief, some getting lost along the way and returning to the inn, but in the ensuing panic all eventually lose the thief among the crowds.

First to return to the Purple Goat Inn, Andr'el informs Fenegir of their run in. Fenegir then suggests asking the guards if they have any information on the whereabouts of the thieves guild. While leaving, Andr'el runs into the rest of the party, and head to their next destination.
