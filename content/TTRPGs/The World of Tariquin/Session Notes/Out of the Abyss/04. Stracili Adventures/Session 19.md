## Session 19
Opening the door, the party finds the entrance area empty, a 10 foot wide stairway heading down sits in the middle of a room, with a wooden door to the left, a hallway further down to the left, a locked gated entrance at the opposite end leading to what looks like an armory, and a door to it's left, behind the stairs. After heading past the doorway on the left, an arrow is fired, and a short conversation is started with the shooter, Jon, before combat begins.

Near the end of the fight, Uraelle identifies Magnus at the end of a hallway and charms him, but unable to come up with a convincing lie, Fenegir knocks him out. The party recovers a set of keys and loot from the various dead guild members and rooms. Investigating the stairwell, the party sees rows of bunk beds, but no additional objects of value, and a set of stairs at the other end.

Heading up the stairs, the party enters the main guild hall. The ceiling depicting a mosaic of Waukeen in profile, and the floor what appears to be a newly carved image of the Fury. Near the stairs, a doorway sits closed, and upon opening, Xael is attacked by Victor, the leader of the thieves guild. Xael is poisoned and falls unconscious, with brief images of devils flashing in his mind. As combat continues, potions are distributed to heal those party members that are felled before Victor dies. Within the room, chests filled with gold and letters of conversation from a place called the Reality Wrinkle, with information regarding someone named The Blessed, Jelltik, and Those Who Hear, tying together a plan to seize the merchant district.

After taking a rest in the guild leaders office, Xael explores the locked gated area, uncovering an armory and prison area. Held within the cells, Xael finds Aymery (missing a few fingers, badly hurt, and his foot smashed), and Phil (emaciated from lack of food). In a third cell, the bloated corpse of Jacobs, the city guard is found. Through the remaining cells, Xael frees various merchants. Rejoining the other party members, the party leaves the thieves guild.
