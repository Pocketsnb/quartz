## Session 24
Resting at the Purple Goat, Xael awakens first and heads downstairs for something to drink. Stealing some alcohol from in front of the inn keeper and attempting to hide the act (Despite the inn keeper not caring), Xael then wakes the rest of the party by ringing Focuses Curse, disrupting Therai's preparations.

Once everyone gathers downstairs for breakfast, the party discusses how best to infiltrate the Earls Keep, running through a variety of scenarios before deciding to just walk up to the gate with information for the Earl. Upon reaching the outer walls, they are greeted by a maid who leads them to the earls quarters. Speaking with the Earl, the parties plans to uncover the mind flayer is figured out and battle ensues, with the mind flayer quickly attacking. The party knocks out the earl, defeating the mind flayer who retreats.

Upon waking, the Earl, describes Ghaerleth Axom, the mind flayers, plans to turn control of the city over to a lord of hell in exchange for forces being sent to the underdark to destroy the demon lords beneath. In the next following days, the Wardens of Twilight clear out the remaining devils within the city, the Earl orders reparation payments from the treasury, and Proclin returns, with news of the Baroness Redwater's forgiveness and possible tasks.
