## Session 21
While instructing Fenegir to enter the trap door, Xael and Uraelle gather parts and pieces of the slain gibbering mouther. Within the room, Xael instructs Fenegir to block the door, before climbing out and placing a bookshelf on top of the trap door. Heading upstairs, Xael disguises himself as the fish-man, interrupting a discussion about tea. Speaking with them and attempting to deceive them, Xael quickly attacks the two at the table. A magical fight erupts, with Andr'el ending it with a fireball. Heading upstairs, the party is assaulted by a fireball and a hail storm cast by the Blessed. Finding that they are quickly loosing ground, Xael rushes up with a silence spell cast on his dagger, turning the fight into one of melee as Andr'el binds Tazlynn's wounds. Killing the cultist on the third floor and capturing The Blessed, Xael breaks her fingers and feeds her a tongue of madness. Taking an hour to rest and interrogates The Blessed, the party finds out Those Who Hear plan to free Tharizdun by following the orders of the Speaker in Dreams, and that a woman is trapped in the basement, who is required to open the way. They also find out that most of what The Blessed says is pure madness with no clear line of thought. After resting, Xael stays behind and slits the Blessed's throat as the party heads into the basement.

As the party climbs down the ladder to the basement, they are assaulted by a greater sense of unease, and upon moving the table and chairs, witness a grotesque affront to their sense of reality. This room defies the boundaries of space as they previously understood them. Distance seems meaningless, angles that should not exist clearly do, and the room itself seems to ebb and flow in time to an alien heartbeat that Xael recognizes. Two figures in dark, hooded robes stand in silence on a floating platform, and an incoherent jabbering erupts from a pile on the floor, a living heap of mouths and flesh and eyes -- a bedlam of howling, hooting, and atonal singing. Curled into a ball on the floor at one end of the room -- it is impossible to tell how far away as the floor keeps shifting within the void-- is a woman in a red gown, clutching her ears and covering her face with her arms. Rubble floats around in the expansive void, and out in the distance, shadowy tentacles can be seen. Navigating the platforms, the party rescues the woman in red, and upon exiting the building and letting some time pass, identifies herself as Clarissa Braewind, a cleric to the Wardens of Twilight. Returning her to the temple and receiving a reward, the party settles down for some much needed rest.
