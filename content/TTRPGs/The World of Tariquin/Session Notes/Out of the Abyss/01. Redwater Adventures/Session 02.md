## Session 02
The following day, the party returns to Glimerton to rest before traveling to the Bloodyfoot Tribe. Upon waking, Aiyu is found in a deep sleep and won’t awaken. The rest of the party, having dealt with this before now, continue without them. Heading southwest, the party is attacked by a pair of giant boars. After defeating the boars, they continue on their way till they reach the current camp of the Bloodyfoot Tribe.

Purchasing a few goods, they see a hunting party returning, curious, they head to the chieftain's tent and speak with Rochel. Rochel asks for assistance in the slaying of a Bulette that has recently assaulted her hunters. Agreeing to help, the party stays the night before being lead by a pair of scouts.

Encountering the Bulette, it instantly slays one of the scouts, though Uraelle deeply wounded the creature with their first attack. After defeating the creature, the party hauls it back for their reward before heading to Glimerton to rest before shopping.

The innkeeper overhears that the party is looking for work, and mentions how people in Tadium have started disappearing again, this time adults and children. Taking a day to shop, the party heads out the next day, reaching Tadium and spending the night with Hari. Andr’el receives a sending message from Master Proclin, mentioning an magical artifact in the area that needs to be recovered before the 20th of Leaffall, the Decanter of Furias.
