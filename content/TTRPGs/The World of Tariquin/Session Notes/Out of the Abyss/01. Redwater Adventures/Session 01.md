## Session 01
The party joined together as a caravan guard within the Barony of Redwater, learning to trust each other in battle, they discovered an ancient trove of treasures under a hanged man, helped place Rochel as chief among the orc tribe Bloodyfoot, set up trade relations between the Kobolds of Iron Hold Keep and the village of Fanon, and rescuing numerous children from what seemed to be bugbear slavers.

Starting on the first day of Leaffall, the High-Harvest Festival has just come to a close and grander adventure awaits. The party drinks around a table at the Glimerton Inn, hearing rumor of an increase of Kobold activity at Iron Hold Keep, and the Orcs of the Bloodyfoot tribe having difficulty with their hunting, as larger game is appearing near the fringes of their land. At first dismissing these claims as unimportant, they later decide to travel to Fanon to see what has developed. Discovering that the Kobolds have started taking farm animals more often, they head to Iron Hold Keep.

Upon arriving at Iron Hold Keep, the party sees an array of light coming from the cracks in the tower. Upon speaking with the Kobolds, they discover that something has appeared, and in order to appease it, they have been feeding it livestock rather than performing sacrifices to their god, The Syndicate. Working out a deal, the Kobolds agree to pay the party if they can kill the creature. Venturing to the lower levels of the keep, the party is beset by Shadows, Darkmantles, and finally, a Manticore from the Shadowfell. Defeating these creatures, the Kobolds gratefully celebrate through the night.
