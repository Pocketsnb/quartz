## Session 03
The following morning, the party speaks with the village elder, mentioning the disappearances happen along the road. While investigating, the party is ambushed by a group of bugbears. After defeating them, they find a note leading them towards the hills; the same hills they rescued the kidnapped children from.

Finding a cave entrance surrounded by cages the party frees numerous prisoners before heading inside. They come across a fire and two arguing bugbears, one of which appears to be the chief, standing near a crude door in the back of the cave. Not understanding what either is saying, the party fails to sneak up on them, but deals with them in time.

Taking a short rest to heal, the party then continues through the door, following a passageway for nearly a half hour before hearing cries of anguish coming from farther down. After another half hour of travel, the party comes across a small cavern with an iron cage at one wall filled with prisoners, and a drow guarding them. Sneaking behind the drow, the party quickly disables the drow and frees the prisoner. The party discusses traveling further down the tunnels and deeper into the underdark when Andrâ€™el then tells them of a message received from Proclin.
