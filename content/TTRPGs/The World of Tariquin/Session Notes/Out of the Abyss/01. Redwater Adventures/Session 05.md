## Session 05
Five days pass after the robbery. Andr’el and Tazlynn remain imprisoned within the Guard Tower, near the center of Rubicon.They are visited once on the second day by the Guard Captain, asking for additional information regarding the artifact stolen, and where it currently is, though no additional information is given.

Xael, meanwhile, stakes out the guards, is imprisoned under the pretenses of being drunk, and attempts to get within the Guard Tower as a painter, all while disguised as either an old homeless man, or various humans.

Uraelle and Aiyu flee to Glimerton, where they try to locate a fence to purchase the stolen wine. Not finding one, they travel to Mali’bu, and settle on selling the wine to a local restaurant, under pretense to sell them additional wines and setting up a distribution center at Glimerton. The two travel back to Glimerton that evening, then set-out to Rubicon the following day. A massive storm intervenes, forcing them to stop half-way through their travels and take shelter from the wind and hail.

In Rubicon, Xael disguises himself as a homeless person and finds shelter within the Guard Tower. Andr’el attempts to escape by freezing the lock, but the iron proves to be stronger than expected. Once the storm passes, the guards head out within the town to perform a relief effort, clearing debris and ensuring people are safe, largely keeping the tower unguarded, as Uraelle and Aiyu continue their travels. However, everyone is ambushed by drow and forced into a deep sleep through various poisons before being taken to Velkynvelve, a drow slave outpost, while unconscious.

Six days they remain imprisoned, gathering materials to escape and meeting their fellow prisoners; Sarith Kzekarith, a disgraced male drow; Eldeth Feldrun, a female dwarf scout from Daramir; and Topsy and Turvy, twin deep gnomes with Topsy being the more social of the pair.

On the seventh day, the party is split to perform menial tasks, when Ilvara Mizzrym, drow priestess and commander of Velkynvelve, approaches taunting one of the groups. Xael becomes over exited, throwing a rock at Ilvara, initiating their “plan” to escape. Nearly a minute later, and the battle is won, with Asha Vandree, the junior priestess escaping with Jorlan Duskryn, Ilvara’s former lieutenant and lover. The party takes a moment to rest, gather supplies, and find their equipment before deciding to follow Sarith to Neverlight Grove.
