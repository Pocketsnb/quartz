## -4200 The first Dragonborn
Following the dragons conquering of the gnomish homeland of Iledagaba on [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Geography/Tariquin/Iletiku/Iletiku|Iletiku]], they used the magic the gnomes had received to transform their eggs into a race of soldiers known as the dragonborn.
The land is renamed Olusturmak, after the first dragon to surmise the possibility of using the gnomish magic to create the Dragonborn.
