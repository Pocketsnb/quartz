## -3700 Behemoth War
Seeing the dragons as a threat, the giants of Kolos went to war.
To end the war, the dragons employed the gnomish magic once more, laying waste to the the land of Kolos and wiping it of all life. Not wishing their magic to be used like that again, the gnomes sought the help of some sympathizing dragonborn and performed the same casting upon their land, turning it to ash.

Those gnomes and dragonborn then fled to [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Geography/Tariquin/Saltus/Saltus|Saltus]] and its surrounding islands.
