## -200,000 Dragon's Conflict
Two exceptionally long lived dragons, recalling the events that created their kind, performed the second [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Magic/Ritual of Ascension|Ritual of Ascension]] themselves, becoming the gods Sovereign and Syndicate.

[[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Syndicate|The Syndicate]], not satisfied with her power, sought to control the world and attacked [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Sovereign|The Sovereign]] and his followers. Many of The Sovereigns kind fell in the conflict before he looked to [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Huntress|The Huntress]] for help, beseeching her to again banish a god to the Abyss, trapping The Syndicate there.

With The Syndicate gone, her followers fled to amass their own power, while The Sovereign and his followers hid among the mortal races.
