## -20,000 Second God's War
Looking to escape the Abyss, [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Syndicate|The Syndicate]] and [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Tangled Web|The Tangled Web]] joined forces to trick a group of humans into performing the [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Magic/Ritual of Ascension|Ritual of Ascension]], giving birth to the gods [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Tamed|The Tamed]], [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Final Path|The Final Path]], [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Warming Sun|The Warming Sun]], [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Cleansing Flame|The Cleansing Flame]], [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Empty Grave|The Empty Grave]], and [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Inner Turmoil|The Inner Turmoil]].

Seeing that the ritual was performed once more, the old gods went to war with the new, [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Writer|The Writer]], and The Warming Sun being the only ones to abstain. Eventually, the truth of the cause behind the ritual is found out, and new factions were formed from the conflict, with [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Crafter|The Crafter]], [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Traveler|The Traveler]], [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Artist|The Artist]], [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Huntress|The Huntress]], [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Sovereign|The Sovereign]], The Final Path, The Warming Sun, and The Cleansing Flame seeking to keep the tricksters within the Abyss. The Empty Grave, The Inner Turmoil, The Tamed, [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Endless Battle|The Endless Battle]] and [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Coming Storm|The Coming Storm]] sought to free The Tangled Web and The Syndicate.

As the war progressed the followers of The Tangled Web reappeared, their skin burned black while in the Abyss, now calling themselves the drow. Major cities fell, lands became infertile, and the populations of each ancestry were decimated. The Inner Turmoil left to the Abyss to find a way to free The Tangled Web and The Syndicate, while The Cleansing Flame followed her in an eternal hunt. The Empty Grave, looking to capitalize upon the dead, started raising them, being opposed by The Final Path who saw the atrocities he was performing.

Seeing the effect they were having upon the material plane, the gods agree to leave and only influence their followers. The drow hid deep underground. The Tamed horrified by what the war did to the land, focused on rebuilding civilization alongside The Warming Sun.
