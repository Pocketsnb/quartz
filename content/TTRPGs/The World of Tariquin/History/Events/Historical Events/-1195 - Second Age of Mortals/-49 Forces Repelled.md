## -49 Forces Repelled
Waging war across the land, it seemed [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Sealed Tome|The Sealed Tome]]’s army was unstoppable, however, the lich's own hubris had him focusing on more lofty goals. Seeking to supplant [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Empty Grave|The Empty Grave]], The Sealed Tome fashioned an artifact, designed to wipe from people’s mind any concept of the god and funnel power from him.

Hearing of this betrayal, The Empty Grave approached Kas and gives orders to stop and dispose of The Sealed Tome.

Abandoning the army, Kas deems to serve The Empty Grave, and heads back west, slaying undead and living as he goes.
