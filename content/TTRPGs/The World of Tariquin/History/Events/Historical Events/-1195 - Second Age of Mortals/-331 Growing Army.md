## -331 Growing Army
After over a century, [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Sealed Tome|The Sealed Tome]] has raised hordes of undead and formulated magic to compel people for an extended time. With this, an army of undead and magically compelled orcs is created. The Sealed Tome approaches and recruits Kas, a former colonel of the Exeger Empire who saw great losses due to poor management by generals and unrest caused by the prophecies. Kas was later infected with vampirism, which lead the Sealed Tome to them.
