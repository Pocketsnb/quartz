## -1195 The First Demon War
Ages ago three great demon lords, Samiramis, Ciacco, and 'Uwbitsu, appeared within the land of the giantsin the [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Geography/Tariquin/Saltus/Realms/Icepeak Mountains/Icepeak Mountains|Icepeak Mountains]]. Aided by the chromatic dragons, they swept across the land. Near the end of the war, an epic battle between paladins and clerics of various races defeated the three demons, their remains cast into a great volcano. [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Magic/Demonic Diseases|Their spirits shattered and spread]] though the mortal plane they had sought to conquer, the fragments becoming the source of vampirism, lycanthropy, and ghoul fever respectively. When a person contracts one of these diseases, their spirit merges with the fragment effectively poisoning their spirit. With the emergence of these new evils, a group called [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Factions/The Wardens of Twilight|the Wardens of Twilight]] was created, acting as protectors of humanity and hunters of these new threats to civilization.
