## 668 The Book of Vile Darkness
Before his death and rise to godhood, [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Sealed Tome|The Sealed Tome]] had also written of many dark and evil things within a tome now known as The Book of Vile Darkness. A young mage and former member of [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Factions/The Alliance of the Golden Dawn|the Alliance of the Golden Dawn]] by the name of Zeratoul stumbled across these writings while exploring the catacombs that The Sealed Tome once resided in. Thinking the world not ready for such knowledge, Zeratoul studied the book in seclusion, eventually succumbing to its inherent evil.
