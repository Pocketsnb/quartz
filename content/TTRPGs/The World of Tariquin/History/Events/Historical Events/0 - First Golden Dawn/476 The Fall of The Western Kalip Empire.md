## 476 The Fall of The Western Kalip Empire
Orcs from many tribes gather under a priest of [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Culture/Pantheon/The Endless Battle|The Endless Battle]] and attack the Western Kalip Empire, seeking vengeance for the destruction of their homeland. Alkan II, the last Emperor of the Western Kalip Empire abdicates the throne. Those who worship Bahamut are welcomed into the Eastern Kalip Empire, others are turned away and spread throughout [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Geography/Tariquin/Saltus/Saltus|Saltus]].
