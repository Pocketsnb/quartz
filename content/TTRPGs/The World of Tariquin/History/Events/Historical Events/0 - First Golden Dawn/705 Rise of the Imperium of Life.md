## 705 Rise of the Imperium of Life
Zeratoul takes a hidden seat of power as Grand Imperator Zeratoul, where once a year, a child of age 10 is sacrificed to him to serve as The Host of the Grand Imperator, whom Zeratoul possesses. Ziggurats, places of worship, are constructed in every town and Zeratoul transformed his high priests into undead shades who feed off the criminals of the populace and keep strict order. Any fed upon is said to have their soul ascended to the heavens, while their body is placed upon a pike around the fringes of the kingdom. Those who live inside call their land [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Geography/Tariquin/Saltus/Realms/The Imperium of Life/The Imperium of Life|The Imperium of Life]], not knowing the horror that runs their lives, while outsiders call it the Husklands.
