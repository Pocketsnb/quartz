## Kault

Located to the north east, the continent of Kault is mostly uninhabited beyond the coastline. Once home to the giants, the land was laid to waste during the [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/History/Events/Historical Events/-10,000 - First Age of Mortals/-3700 Behemoth War|Behemoth War]] by the dragons use of gnomish magic. The costal region is home to numerous barbaric humanoid tribes, fierce creatures, chilling winters, and a few settlements. Ruins of a civilization of giant necromancer kings are said to lay beyond the ring of mountains known as [[Tariquin Campaign Setting/Geography/Tariquin/Kault/Katai's Maw|Katai's Maw]].

There are a few small settlements, mountain men, and homesteaders that brave the harsh winters and frequent raids, seeking freedom from their past, avoidance of the law, or the adventure of living in such a harsh place.
