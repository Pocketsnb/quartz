# [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Bremen|Bremen]]
_Population: ~150_
Sitting in solitude on the west bank of Maer Dualdon, a trip to Bremen does not carry a lot of interest to those who cannot travel by boat. With a small trail - which is perilously washed away during the flooding season by the Shaengarne River - travel by caravan is ill advised much most of the year.

## Inns & Taverns
### Buried Treasures
This inn makes its namesake by catering to those who come from other parts of Ten-Towns to spend a few days panning the riverbanks. While busy in the late summer months, it is sparsely occupied during the rest of the year.
### Five Tavern Center
A group of five taverns that makes up Bremen's nightlife. Of the taverns, the one named Stones is the most popular. Due to the tavern's close proximity to one another, many-a-fisticuffs have broken out in the town's square.
## Shops
### Ewin's Trinkets
A small shop which buys magical items that treasure seekers find on the riverbanks, which it then sells at a favorable mark-up.
