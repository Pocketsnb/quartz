# [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Lonelywood|Lonelywood]]
_Population: ~100_
The most northern town in the Frozenfar is also its most polarizing. While the town is not without those engaging in fishing or forestry, its townsfolk don't always possess the most noble of origins. An unspoken anonymity exists amongst the folks of Loneywood: don't ask questions for which you don't want the answers. Each person assumes everyone else has a secret to hide, and so they live together in a community built on mutual ignorance.

## Inns & Taverns
### Lucky Liar
A favorite local tavern to fishers and woodcutters, where
they spend the evenings telling tall tales.
### Ramshackle
An appropriately named inn, whose hasty construction is shown in the roof and walls that do little to combat the dale's harsh winter months.

## Shops
### Happy Scrimshander
A small shop with scrimshander trade goods.
### Pavel's Used Goods
A general store with limited selection.

## Landmarks
### Shrine to Mielikki
Catti-brie constructed a small garden shrine devoted to the Forest Queen in the woods a short distance from Lonelywood.
