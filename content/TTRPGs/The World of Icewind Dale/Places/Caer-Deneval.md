# [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Caer-Deneval|Caer-Deneval]]
![[Assets/Images/Maps/Caer-Dineval.png]]_Population: ~100_
Prior to the completion of The Eastway, caravans would forgo travelling to [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Easthaven|Easthaven]]. Instead, they would make their way east from [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Bryn Shander|Bryn Shander]] and head north, following the unkempt trail along the shore of Lac Dinneshere. This allowed Caer-Dineval to maintain a semblance of power and predominance among the Ten-Towns. In current times, few traders make the journey, choosing instead to head to Easthaven to peddle their goods. Those wishing to visit the small town also first travel to along The Eastway to Easthaven, and then hire a ferry to take them across the lake. This gives travelers ample time to loosen their purse strings before arriving in Caer-Dineval, much to the town's chagrin.

## Inns & Taverns
### Dinev's Rest
The first building travelers see when arriving by caravan, the inn is quite spacious, more so when compared to the town's other buildings.
### The Uphill Climb
A tavern in the northeastern part of town that serves brews from Good Mead.
## Shops
### Culver's
Not a shop in the traditional sense, instead this establishment is home to a collection of unique goods collected over the years.

## Landmarks
### Caer
The only standing castle in the Ten-Towns.
### Ruined Watchtower
A destroyed guardhouse that once overlooked the town's harbor.
### Knucklehead Harbor
This small anchorage that serves the town's fleet of ships.
