# [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Targos|Targos]]
_Population: ~1,000_
As the only other walled community in Ten-Towns, Targos frequently shares comparisons with [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Bryn Shander|Bryn Shander]]. While both towns are overly active, it is the bustling docks that support Targos' fishing industry serving as the distraction instead of a vibrant market as in the capital.
This distinction is present in the way townsfolk conduct themselves throughout the day. While those in Bryn Shander can be seen populating the streets and markets during the day, conversing with one another before populating taverns in the evening of shared drink, the townsfolk of Targos are focused solely on their livelihood. Always walking with a purpose - focused solely on their tasks during the day before retiring to bed at night to prepare for the next morning.

## Inns & Taverns
### Luskan Arms
The oldest taphouse in Ten-Towns, established back when Bryn Shander was still just "the cabin on the hill". The inn and tavern were fashioned to attract many of the old traders who made the trip from Luskan.
### Three Flags Sailing
A tavern that caters to fishermen coming in off the lake after a grueling day of work. Known for ruckus nights and drag performances. Owned by [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/People/Ethen 'Ma' Yarbroul|Ethen 'Ma' Yarbroul]] .
### Trip and Shuffle
A rowdy tavern founded by a Purple Dragon knight that fled from a death sentence in Cormyr.
### Wolf's Pelt Inn
A modest inn with a barroom, common room, private rooms, storage, and a kitchen.

## Shops
### Gallaway Trade Depot
A general store located in the main town at the top of the cliffs.
### Graendel's Fine Dwarven Craft
A smithy that makes fine supplies. Everything sold is made-to-order.
### Market Square
Once a prestigious market, it has dwindled in size as most folks choose to sell their wares in Bryn Shander.
### Triglio
A general store, named for one of the chanteys that the fishers often sing when hard at work upon the lake: "Trigl-ee-oh, lads, an' 'oist upon the line - Trigl-ee-oh, lads, an' bring yon fishers in."

## Landmarks
### The Dockworkers' Guildhouse
Targos is the only community in Ten-Towns that has a guild - namely, the dockworkers' guild, representing the town's shipwrights, warehouse workers, and loaders.
