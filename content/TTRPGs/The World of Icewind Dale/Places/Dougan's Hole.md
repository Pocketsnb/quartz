_Population: ~50_
The town of Dougan's Hole has never had much of a namesake in the Ten-Towns, being the smallest of Icewind Dales communities. Synonymous with the town where they are built, its roads are unkempt with barely enough gravel on them to halt the overgrowth during the summer months. The winter is even harsher, as the paths are frequented with enough snow to stop travel in and out of town completely.

## Landmarks
### Twenty Stones of Thruun
A megalith structure consisting of twenty granite slabs arranged in an equilateral triangle that overlooks the town. Researchers across Faer√ªn believe that Thruun was a god who disappeared from the pantheon long ago, but no one really knows for sure.
