# [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Termalaine|Termalaine]]
_Population: ~600_
Nestled in between the shores of Maer Dualdon to the west and a forest to the east, few of the Ten-Towns hold the beauty of Termalaine. While employing an adequate fleet, crafters and artisans are as numerous here as fishermen, and their work serves to improve the town's natural beauty. The town has a tranquil elegance that is only enhanced by the populous that live here. Intricate carvings brand the log-work buildings, with scrimshaw ornaments hanging as wind chimes from their windows.
While the people who live here are as hard-working as those form their other Ten-Towns, they tend to be openly friendly, good-natured, and welcoming of visitors. They are proud of the town they have created and want to share its charm with the few foreigners that make the trip from [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Bryn Shander|Bryn Shander]].

## Landmarks
### Gem Mine
A small cave entrance set into a low hill near Termalaine contains a mine plentiful with tourmaline gemstones. However, the mine goes deeper than the townsfolk have explored, and creatures from the Underdark are known to seek access to the surface through the mine. When this happens, the mine is sealed off until the threat has been dealt with.
