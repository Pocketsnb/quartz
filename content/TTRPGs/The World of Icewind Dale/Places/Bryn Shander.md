# [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Bryn Shander|Bryn Shander]]
_Population: ~1,200_
The walled establishment of Bryn Shander resides upon a hill, with snowy plains expanding out in all directions. There are three points of entry into the town - the north, south, and east gates - with each connecting Bryn Shander with the rest of the communities in the dale. Heading out of the Eastern Gate, a paved road approximately named The Eastway, connects Bryn Shander with the town of [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Easthaven|Easthaven]]. The Northern Gate connects Bryn Shander with the only other walled community in the Ten-Towns, [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Targos|Targos]], before diverging west (towards [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Bremen|Bremen]]) and east (towards [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Termalaine|Termalaine]] and then on to [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Lonelywood|Lonelywood]]). The Southern Gate heads south and connects Bryn Shander (and the Ten-Towns as a whole) with the rest of the Sword Coast.
[[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/People/Duvessa Shane|Duvessa Shane]] is the speaker of Bryn Shander.

## Inns & Taverns
### Bloodril's Snug Haven
The Snug Haven was poorly constructed. It stood high above ground level, which offered little protection from icy winds and freezing temperatures. Its poor construction of the ironically named Snug Haven left guests of the inn
cold and shivering.
### Faelfaril's Inn
A large inn with 20 rooms, a feasting hall, and good selection of drinks. However, the inn was built by someone who never spent a winter in Icewind Dale, and thus the inn is barely warmer than the air outside.
### Geldenstag's Rest
One of the oldest establishments in town, the inn's accommodations are fairly lackluster, but the proprietor of the inn's nosey nature often led those who had something to hide to avoid the inn.
### Hooked Knucklehead
A longstanding inn that caters to the scrimshanders and traders from the other towns looking to do business in Bryn Shander.
### Kelvin's Comfort
The most popular taverns in town, owing to its extensive stock of dwarven ales and brandies. The tavern was famous for its signature drink, Flamebeard's Firebrandy.
### The Northlook
An inn dedicated to mercenaries and adventurers, giving it a (deserved) reputation for being the rowdiest place to stay in Bryn Shander. It is a great place get leads on profitable ventures, along with the latest news and rumors.
Owned by scarred human male, [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/People/Scramsax|Scramsax]].

## Shops
### Blackiron Blades
A small shop and smithy just north of the main square. Well known as a one-stop shop for adventurers with the cheapest supplies in the Ten-Towns.

### Statue of Tiago Baenre
In 1466 DR, a drow warrior named Tiago Baenre defeated the balor Errtu on a plain outside the southern gates of Bryn Shander, endearing himself to the city. The land where the balor fell was forever blackened - no snow falls there, nor does any vegetation grow. In commemoration of that historic event, a statue of the drow was constructed on that spot with a plaque that reads: _"On this spot did Master Tiago slay the demon. And the snows will cover it nevermore."_
