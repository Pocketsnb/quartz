# [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Caer-Konig|Caer-Konig]]
_Population: ~150_
Found perilously close to the Icewind Pass, Caer-Konig rests on the southern slope of Kelvin's Cairn and just north of Lac Dinneshere. Visible to all who approach by boat is the destroyed caer that gave this town its name.
While traders can travel to Caer-Konig along the trail that continues north from Caer-Dineval, most do not. Instead, those who choose to travel to the most northern point on Lac Dinneshere do so by boat, although many choose not to bother with the journey at all. Caer-Konig is commonly referred to the town as "the poor man's Caer-Dineval", a name most certainly coined by natives of Caer-Dineval, and only exemplified to those who set their eye upon the limited selection of shops and markets.
With trade being practically non-existent in the town, Caer-Konig looked to secure a different form of clientele: adventurers. Resting at the base of Kelvin's Cairn, an outpost called Frozenfar Expeditions serves as a gathering point for those looking to head out on treks up the mountainside.

## Inns & Taverns
### Hook, Line, and Sinker
The busiest establishment in town, owing its popularity to the free half-pints of ale on a table near the front door. The first one is always free, as they say...
### Northern Light
The town's sole inn, where adventurers rest in-between expeditions to Kelvin's Cairn.

## Shops
### Market Square
A small market near the harbor, typically stocked with fishing or mountaineering gear.

## Landmarks
### Frozenfar Expeditions
Although is has a small storefront, this establishment serves as Icewind Dale's make-shift adventurer's guild. Postings to slay beasts or find missing loved ones populate its boards.
### Ruined Caer
The destroyed caer after which the town was named. It has been rebuilt a few times, but always ends up sharing a similar fate.
