_Population: ~100_
The small town of Good Mead is known for one thing, the mead hall stands out on the only road through town. Donning carvings in the likeness of wyverns that are said to roost in Kelvin's Cairn, the mead hall is usually the only stop for visitors passing through town.

## Inns & Taverns
### Mead Hall
A massive two-story building with an adjoining storage structure for casks. Much of the building's expansion was constructed out of the town's ships that were no longer needed on lake Redwaters.

## Landmarks
### Shrine to Tempus
An old shrine devoted to the Lord of Battles shows its age with chipped and faded paintings.
