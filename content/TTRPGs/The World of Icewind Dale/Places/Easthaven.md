# [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Easthaven|Easthaven]]
_Population: ~750_
Set on the coast of Lac Dinneshere, the prosperous town of Easthaven has seen a great expansion in recent years. Grow to the south to reach the The Redrun river, and to the west, cutting down much of the forest that once stood there. The scent of harvested pine trees fills the air as new construction continues to expand the town's perimeter ever outward. Inside the town proper, spacious shops, inns, and taverns welcome locals and travelers alike. Extravagantly painted signs bring wanted attention, with trappers looking to sell pelts from their latest catch inside shops that also offer the latest fashions from across the Sword Coast.

## Inns & Taverns
### Banrock's Mithral Pot
The most popular tavern in all of the Ten-Towns, with a reputation that extends beyond Icewind Dale. Folks from across the Sword Coast make the trip to Easthaven just to sample the fabled pottage made here.
### Big Fat Knucklehead
A boisterous lakeside tavern that caters to fishermen.
### Cairn's Crossing
The oldest of Easthaven's inns. Most of the traders coming to Easthaven stay here out of habit, so the inn does a respectable business.
### Snowdrift Inn
An inn near the harbor surrounded by racks of drying knucklehead trout, giving surrounding area an offensively fishy smell.
### White Lady Inn
A popular inn and tavern located near the harbor, which enjoys beautiful views overlooking Lac Dinneshere. The inn takes its name from a local legend about the ghost of Lac Dinneshere: a spectral being that hovers above the surface of the lake on the clearest of nights.
### Winter's Cradle Tavern
A cozy tavern that caters to adventurers. Its warm hearth keeps the northern chill at bay.
## Shops
### Harbor Market Square
While not quite as large as the Market Square in Bryn
Shander, the Harbor Market in Easthaven is a sight to
behold in its own right.
### Rurden's Armory
An outlet for adventurers to equip themselves with dwarven-made blades and mail forged in the valley below Kelvin's Cairn.
## Landmarks
### Redrun
A shallow river that flows from Lac Dinneshere into Redwaters. It is normally calm enough to cross on foot by wading into the chest-high water, except during late spring, when the waters rage with frothing whitecaps.
### Silvanus's temple
White birch trees form a grove roughly two miles outside of Easthaven. Atop the hillside overlooking Lac Dinneshere, those who wish to bask in the Oak Father's wisdom congregate under the full moon each month.
