## Log

Turns out, Torga is a jerk and doubles cost of goods she sells, often being curt and not willing to barter. Kallum insults her, and that will cause the ten towns to not deal positively with us.
Maggie and Kallum speak with Ma and Cynthia about people potentially not being on the lottery, but get nowhere, see a sled dog and sled without a rider go by.
Lark and [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/People/Hook|Hook]] watch Sephek and Torga, Sephek likely to head to Three Flags Sailing. Lark was poor on stealth and hurts themselves on a wall, and scares a stray cat away. Later, Sephek investigates where Lark was, in the cursed alley, but Lark had left. Sephek leaves the long way to Three Flags, and Hook follows. Lark takes the quick path.

Sled dog is from a guide who might be lost, and his husband ([[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/People/Keegan Velryn|Keegan Velryn]]) is distraught. Went to Kelvin's Cairn via [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Caer-Konig|Caer-Konig]].

Sephek reached Three Flags Sailing.
Party followed him, he was attempting to pick open a door when the party stopped him and killed him. He melted away.
