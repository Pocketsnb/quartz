## Session Summary
The party begins investigating the murder scene and neighborhood. The neighbors seem to know nothing, but there was a blue textile present in the window of the house. While leaving, [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/People/Hook|Hook]] receives an eerie message of "death is near", and discusses with the party his curse.
The party then heads to the market and purchases some winter goods and meet with [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/People/Mythica|Mythica]], who gives them a quest to deliver a brimstone cube to [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/People/Cynthia Reed|Cynthia Reed]] in [[TTRPGs/The World of Icewind Dale/Places/Targos|Targos]].
Heading off to Targos in hopes of finding Sephek, the party is beset by a blizzard. Losing Kallum on the way, they search and luckily find him, though he appeared unaffected.
Upon reaching Targos, the blizzard subsides. A child informs us of a good tavern, Three Flags Sailing, and the party heads there. Enjoying a great show and good drinks and stew, the party delivers the brimstone cube to Cynthia Reed, who has some form of mechanical creature as a partner.
Speaking with the proprietor of the Tavern, 'Ma', the party is told that Sephek can likely be found near Triglio, a general market in Targos. Heading there, the party spots Sephek and his patron Torga, identifying the scrap of blue cloth as being a part of Sepheks clothing.
