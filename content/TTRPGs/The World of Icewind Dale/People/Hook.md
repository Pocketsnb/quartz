## Secrets
Hook is haunted by Shar, the goddess of darkness and night, and as such, the shadows around him often do not behave as normal shadows.
He is looking for his sister, Bright Light of the New Moon.
He and his sister are the last of the Drab Forest clan of Chult.

## Background
Fishing Hook Returning in Summer (Hook) comes from a small clan of 60 tabaxi within the wilds of Chult. Born to a caring family of the Drab Forest clan, his father, Crecent, was a priest of Selûne, while his mother, Grass, assisted with hunting. His elder sister, Bright, was an acolyte to his father, and at a young age Hook joined them, mainly assisting in gathering sacrifices.

Hook often begged his father to let him perform a ceremony, but was always told he wasn't old enough, so one night, Hook snuck out of his families hut to the alter of Selûne. There, he performed a ceremony that went wrong and called forth wraiths from the Shadowfell. Bright had followed him out and watched in hiding and luckily saved his life, but the damage was done as the wraiths descend on the village. Half the clan died that night, including his mother. Bright was blamed for what happened and as punishment, cast out from the tribe. Too afraid to say anything, Hook kept quiet, tightly hugging to his fathers robes.

As time passed, his father, previously strict but kind, became more stern and overly engrossed in his worship, even yelling at people that got too close to the alter of Selûne. As such, Hook had to take on increased duties, serving as the sole hunter for the two of them and the goddess.

It also seemed that Hook was touched that night he performed the ceremony, as shadows around him sometimes do not behave as expected. A chairs shadow could move indifferent to a fire pits flickering flame, while his own shadow always seemed to lag slightly behind.

Thirteen years later, tragedy struck the Drab Forest clan once again, as a roaming undead dinosaur came through killing everyone, taking Hook's left ear, and leaving scars across his side. Determined to stay optimistic, Hook picked up what wealth he could from the destroyed village and left to Port Nyanzaru.

It was within Port Nyanzaru, after a few misadventures with the local dwarves there, that he learned his sister Bright had lived there for 7 years as a privateer under a captain Gavin, before leaving north to Baldur's Gate. With nothing better to do, Hook decided to follow after and find his sister.

Upon reaching Baldur's Gate, he learned his sister worked as a harbormaster for a few years before leaving south to Candlekeep for a month, returning, and promptly leaving north to Waterdeep. Following her trail and reaching Waterdeep, Hook learned his sister had worked at the House of the Moon as a priest and she had spoken often of what she learned behind the walls of Candlekeep. It seems Bright was after an artifact known as The Tear of Selûne, and wished to bring it to the Drab Forest clan, hoping to regain her place.

Unfortunately, his sister had headed to Icewind Dale by way of Luskan last winter after speaking with someone who the other priests described as a cloaked and drunken gentleman. Wanting to reach the Ten Towns before winter set in, Hook booked passage on the last ship out. He has been but 4 days in the Ten Towns, has yet to find any clue to his sister's whereabouts, and the shadows around him seem to be more active than before.

Hook now finds himself low on coin and far from the warm lands he used to call home, determined to find and aid his sister where he can.

## Notes
