  description: "Dear Diary,\n\nBerline, the Blood Lord of Graydirge asked me to visit her estate; beautiful grounds, lots of great food. There I met a few other aquaintences of hers at a dinner party, and we were asked to investigate Old Ergagh's farm that a distant cousin of hers was running. It's been missing shipments lately and she suspects foul play. She asked us to investigate and get it back in order. In repayment, we'd be given a manor for our own use. \nOn our way there, we came across a sqabble between a farmer and a starving ghoul, the poor thing. She was just trying to have a meal, and the farmer wanted to *bury it* but law dictates it should be reanimated. Kaz, the great chef, scared away the ghoul and gave a stern talking and a bit of coin to the farmer.\n\nWe made the rest of the trek to Old Ergagh's farm and were immediately beset by the mindless, harried by this large bossy cow on the loose named Mosghuta who has a scythe in her side, and forced into a supply building to recover. Kaz and Grimnir, they're a minotaur, say there's a cave to the south west with light coming from it. We're gonna try and make our way sneakily there. Hopefully my tail doesn't get too much in the way."
